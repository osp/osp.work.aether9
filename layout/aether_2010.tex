ghost trio - found this.

We're revealing our adaptation of  "Ghost Trio," by Beckett on  
Saturday December 15th. Written in 1975, taped in '76 and televised on  
BBC2 in 1977. It is a parallel universe played out in the same slice  
of time as the first wave of British punk. Beckett, I wish we'd met.

My fellow aethernauts and I would be delighted if you would join us  
live on-line at our first \stylerefmailthemes{chance}\stylerefroad{582}{49} to bring this play from TV to a wider  
audience. It doesn't matter what you're wearing and you won't have to  
worry about how you're getting home.

Members of Aether9 will be performing from Medellin, Yorba Linda,  
NYC , Brussels, Geneva, and Paris. The audience, those in the same  
room, will be joined at 'Videomedja 2007' at the Museum of Vojvodina,  
Novi Sad, Serbia, by two Aether9 artists from Austria and Slovinia who  
will host the Q \& A which follows the performance.

There are no complicated programs or hardware involved. It is easier  
than getting out of the house. I hope you will look through our site  
at  www.1904.cc where the collaborative process involved is quite  
transparent, our project laid out, and participants credited. Here we  
will make the links "to set up your computer" so easy that you will  
practically fall through them.

You will need to go through one link to find out what the time will be  
where you are, when it is Saturday at 11:15 PM in Serbia. The second  
link opens the audience viewing window and a third link leads to  
instructions to stream sound.

We all wait inside our distractions to see what is outside time,  
beyond words, without location, and never in complete control …….....

Installation Sound \stylerefmailtech{loop}\stylerefroadrwdonly{619} Guidelines
This is an 8+ hour Public installation so please select your audio files with
these things in mind:

1. Voice reading a text in narratively engaging tone. Can be an essay
about aether theories, or narrative. should be possible to
understand/follow.
2. Very short audio-loop of only a few seconds, that is interesting to
listen to when looping for 1-2 minutes (maybe with slight shift in
volume and speed). should not be too disruptive / rhythmic - it should
be usable as a background for a reading voice.
3. Avoid annoying sounds or standard crowd noise that would just blend
into a large room of talking people.
4. The content relates to the visual material we're streaming
(landscapes of us see below)
5. \stylerefmailslow{ambient}\stylerefroadrwdonly{622} synthesizer or radio wave sounds in upper frequencies.

”LANDSCAPES OF US” (working title)

This idea is inspired somehow by Vimeo group called ”The Pictures
Don't Move” \hyphenatedurl{http://www.vimeo.com/groups/thepicturesdontmove} and of
course Judy's idea about the leaves. Idea would be to create
landscapes or sceneries by using different streams: even though each
stream is different and from different location, together they create
a whole scenery (this is something Aether has done with drawing, I
guess, but now it would be live footage). It's pretty simple, here's a
sketch that explains a bit: \hyphenatedurl{http://www.artsufartsu.net/IMG\_2438.JPG}

But what would be the sceneries, then? Should there be one or more?
Could there be themes like, e.g, earth, wind, water and fire? Urban,
forest, countryside? What is nature anyways? It should just be your
localized nature. Like Judy's idea of shooting out your window. Just
pick some image in your area that you can safely stream the whole
8 hours. Or the aethernaut could have different setups say 8 different
1 hour landscapes. I like this change idea.

As of now the 9 aether frames will be like an exqusite corpes \stylerefmailslow{landscape}\stylerefroadfwdonly{634} image
the top three sky streams
the middle 3 frames horizon
and the lower 3 earth ground streams
A localized scene from your area is preferred


So far we have confirmed
Mari Keski-Korsu (possibly streaming in on location)

Christiaan Cruz

It'd be nice to 4 or more Aethernauts streaming live landscape
so ask Friends and family about availability on Friday March 26th Helsinki time
Just introduce them via the list and one of us can setup a \stylerefmailchat{Skype}\stylerefroadrwdonly{606} \stylerefmailchat{chat}\stylerefroadfwdonly{656} date to
help them get used to using the \stylerefmailpatch{Patch}\stylerefroad{619}{625} if needed.

residency agence TOPO current situation

\styleinfos

ideacritik

19.02.2010

\stylemail


hi all,

i've been in contact with Eva Quintas president of agence TOPO where i
sent a proposal for an aether9 residency about a month ago. the current
proposal is the following: (it is still to be confirmed whether they
accept or not)

5 week residency ending with a performance at the 'geo-web installation'
festival at the Cinematheque.

theme: "lost in montreal"
this theme adresses the mobility of the actor (to be developped in
residency) and the aspect of discovery ('getting lost') linked to
cinematographic explorations of the avant-garde (esthetic). (wink wink
manu : )

schedule:

week 1-3: (audrey @ TOPO - other agents remotely present)
-\stylerefmailpatch{pd}\stylerefroadrwdonly{624} \stylerefmailpatch{Patch}\stylerefroadfwdonly{628} development
-developemnt of mobile interface (method to control \stylerefmailtech{upload}\stylerefroad{624}{627}, contrast,
etc., actions with a WII contoller)
week 4-5: (audrey and chris @ TOPO - other agents remotely present)
-explorations and experimentation with mobile interface
-script
-performance

dates (approximate) : mid-may to mid-june 2010
place: montreal

this is perhaps a bad translation and certainly an abrieviated version
which does not convey the extremely fun aspect of this new prospect of
running around town with a magic wand uploading images to the interface.
in any case as soon as/if we have confirmation we'll get down to details.

audrey

Hi,

Once more, THANK YOU very much for your hard work and amazing creation 
in Pixelache Camp yesterday. It was such a nice experience. I also want 
to apologise once more that I had difficulties on concentrating in 
between the virtual discussion of us and talking about the work with 
people in physical space. Both sides lack in this situation, that's for 
sure. But I hope you won't hate me, still :)

I uploaded some pics to my Flickr account, I will ad them to the Aether9 
group after Paula accepts me as a member of it.

Hello Mari

Thank you for uploading the photos. The festival looks very nice!
After seeing the photos I really think that it is a pity that I couldn't
come...
But it was a very nice experience to stream with Audrey from the garden. It
was so strange to walk around there in this very quiet garden next to a busy
street, making pictures from grass, water and clouds, while trying not to
loose the connection. Somehow it seemed very bizarre to me, especially to do
this live. But it is really nice to get feedback and to see some photos of
the installation with the audience. The setting, the projection inside the
white cube, is really nice!

i especially like:
\hyphenatedurl{http://www.flickr.com/photos/artsufartsu/4466814176/}
(our new aether9 'do' ? :)

apart from the usual chaos of our performances i appreciated yesterday for
a few reasons. first of all it was nice to be perfoming for so long (some
hours) while people where casually walking in and out of the space (i
imagine) because this meant mkk was giving us 'live' feedback on what is
getting through to people. comments like - 'yes text helps' - or - 'add a
shot of your faces in the \stylerefmailtech{loop}\stylerefroad{629}{639}' - etc.

cym and i were indeed reflecting on what could possibly indicate to
viewers that this is live - it is otherwise just pleasant scenery. ideas
like adding the occasional mugshot, or the computer in 'the wild' are the
start of a list we should elaborate upon.

manu i loved your train and 'wandering' streaming! i also thought that
much of the sound that was streaming yesterday was such a huge improvement
on our tired sound bank. at one point the music coupled with the image was
so fitting - i had a moment - one of those randomly programmed ones...

next perfo coming april 21st in amsterdam - more on that soon.

Hi all,

big thanks to Mari for running the show at Camp Pixelache!

It was a very interesting perfo for me as i was testing a new streaming 
setup:
- little AsusEEE netbook (running the \stylerefmailpatch{Patch}\stylerefroadrwdonly{629} in WinXP)
- cheapo USB \stylerefmailtech{webcam}\stylerefroadfwdonly{662} (Aiptek VGA+)
- mobile USB web access

The first session was a near total failure, as it was raining heavily, 
and I realized that it's impossible to operate laptop+cam while holding 
an umbrella! In addition to that, the botanical garden where I was 
trying to stream from turned out to be in a no-\stylerefmailtech{network}\stylerefroadrwdonly{638} zone between two 
hills.

During the afternoon sessions, rain stopped, and I got used to the 
process of quickly connecting the USB modem, entering PIN, launching \stylerefmailpatch{Max}\stylerefroadfwdonly{640} 
patch, adjusting cam settings, all in a couple of minutes. And as Cym 
says, it's a very weird and fascinating feeling, sending the live images 
from a quiet natural outside location.

The connection was surpraisingly stable, even in a rolling train there 
were no disconnections. It looks like switzerland has a dense coverage, 
appart from mountainous zones. This opens lots of opportunities for 
outside streaming, and I think the direction of "mobile documentary 
event coverage" is something to explore, where the "realtime" element 
can make real sense.

Also, specially in the later hours of the performance, I think we worked 
out a good sense of composition withing our 9 frames (in terms of 
geometry, colors)... hopefully the sign that there *is* some ongoing 
progress in our familiarity with the tool / framework :)

i just pasted together a few clips that i had the good idea to record

do not forget: the \stylerefmailpatch{Patch}\stylerefroad{639}{658} *has the ability to record* with the little 
"rec" button under the preview window ... it creates small quicktime 
files that don't take much space on the harddrive, so you can record a

\stylemail


good afternoon,

yesterday immediately after the performance maaike (actress), cym and i
had to take everything down in less than 10min. this meant we had to
immediately shut down computers, beamers, etc.

some feedback from organisors:
-beautiful, 'it really worked for me' this kindof \stylerefmailslow{slow}\stylerefroad{634}{670} trance like medium.
(in short we are invited to develop something for museumnacht in november
- more on that in another email)
-maaike was a really great actress (i agree)

other feedback:
-it was really clear that it fell apart (timing, etc).
-interesting how you work with a form (telematic performance) that was
explored in pre-days of internet and then some how dropped out.

for my part i would like to thank you all for participating in this
unpaid, unexpectedly very demanding, and extremely chaotic performance (+
rehearsals). it was not easy - thanks for hanging in there!!! the
performance was certainly not a great success (timing was pretty off) but
considering the chaos and the single rehearsal we did quite all right.
amsterdam was pretty solid thanks to the script with timing. this
countered the lack of timing in the interface.

i think we are at some sort of a x-road. there have been many tensions
mounting, namely: diverging ideas about the future of aether9, possible
directions, where to invest energy, time, etc.

i think it is time to organise a \stylerefmailchat{chat}\stylerefroad{624}{7} meeting in which these things can be
discussed. i myself have many issues and frustrations with this group at
the moment which need to be adressed (especially in light of the upcoming
residency). i think the mailing-list is not the place to do this. the fact
that misscommunication cannot be immediately addressed in a chat channel
can lead to huge unnecessary tensions. i suggest a meeting over the
weekend. late enough that columbia/california dont have to again wake up
before 7am!

so suggestions?
saturday or sunday evening? (lets say 21:00CET?)

lets please keep this discussion off list. after all it is 'public'.

hi audrey,

good to read this feedback, and thanks for adressing directly issues of 
future development of the project.

agreed. interestingly, the two latest performances we did, pixelache and 
now amsterdam, went into two totally different directions:
- using the interface as canvas, working without a storyline, rather 
exploring rules of visual composition.
- following a precise storyline, with caracters, precise timing, 
narrative interrelation of frames.

i notice that i find the first option is much closer to my own 
interests. so for me, that's definitely the direction i would envision 
to work with. i also wrote about this in the proposal that was sent 
recently to the list:

possible for me on sunday, but rather at 22:00 CET.

best,
manuel

I'll check it out again for sure. I had a lot of trouble with
purdyne on my laptop but that was years ago. It worked well,
but never got the resolution of my laptop's LCD right. It'll
be interesting to see what has happened since then, but
after we finish the Montreal project.

As an update to that:
I got a wiimote working to control \stylerefmailpatch{pd}\stylerefroad{640}{662} on a Kubuntu laptop.
Audrey's got a functioning PDpatch running on her linux box.
We both have working webcams on pd within linux distros.
And everyone must put availablities into the PiratePad
and start contributing:

hi all,

chris and i are working our asses off (despite the beautiful beer drinking
terasse sitting weather taking over the city). the alpha alpha \stylerefmailpatch{Patch}\stylerefroadrwdonly{658} is
pretty much done - wii remote action up next. im half-way through the
script/scenario (will \stylerefmailtech{upload}\stylerefroad{639}{2} very soon). local actor jordan arseneault has
contributed loads to the script/scenario and i think it has tremendous
potential!

**rectification: may 26th showtime: 19h30CET this is confirmed!**

audrey

ps to answer the linux/osx question - we are working on linux exclusively
at the moment because we plan (in the future) to make a boot cd (that is
os independant, that everyone can use regardless of what operating system
they use). so those who want to try it out for now must have a linux
system and some patience to install other libraries and etc - or a
puredyne type boot cd (i havent tried this either). therefore it is
foreseeable that everyone else but the montreal crew ends up using the \stylerefmailpatch{Max}\stylerefroadfwdonly{670}
patch for the next gig :)

...that all folks! :) ...
