The html works good so far. You N3krozofties are FAST!
The console window doesn't pop up to the correct 
size though; usually too small.
Is there anything else you need help with?
Any specific feedback, beta testing 
calls/submissions or dirty work?
Please let me know.

depends probably how your toolbars look like.
anyway, the intended setup is double screen:
the video frames in full screen, projected.
the control window on a control monitor.
so the resize is not really needed, just practical for testing on 1 
small screen.

>Is there anything else you need help with?
>Any specific feedback, beta testing

- FEEDBACK: think of what else should/could be implemented in this 
"html-patch".
the principle for now is: one main frame - 
http://www.1904.cc/~aether/mainframe.html
which is divided in a number of subframes (for now six)
for each location, there are different versions of subframes with 
different refresh speed (for now three)
e.g.  http://www.1904.cc/~aether/frame_brussels_m.html (m: medium 
speed, 1sec refresh)
I attach the zipped html files so you can test in your computer...

one function that needs to be implemented would be to change the 
frame color of one video in order to highlight it - just a different 
html page, or could this be done in a smart way, like a javascript 
link that changes style settings of target frame on mouseclick?

another function i would like to test is a "hi-speed" mode: a html 
page where the jpegs would be placed in different layers, only one of 
them visible at a time, and where the page would cycle through them 
at very high speed (its quite easy to do using dreamweavers timeline 
function). there would be no refresh in this mode since refresh needs 
more time.

- BETA TESTING: yes, please test this HTML refresh mode by uploading 
some pictures and seeing if they refresh instantly as they should.
using for the moment the following directories:
http://artslashmedia.net/~aether/z/0z.jpg  (select:Sydney)
http://artslashmedia.net/~aether/g/1g.jpg  (select:Brussels)
http://artslashmedia.net/~aether/e/2e.jpg  (select:Geneva)

Also, we should test the different existing webcam-2-ftp softwares. 
Window users should give a try to these open-source softs:
http://lundie.ca/fwink/
http://www.webcam2000.info/

tell us if they work, and how the .pngs or .jpgs are going the be 
named - this will allow me the include the good filepath into the 
HTML page.

- CALLS/SUBMISSIONS
yes, you are all very welcome to look for opportunities to present 
this project elsewhere, write submissions, fill out forms etc. if 
someone of you is volunteering for this job, i will be glad to 
transmit all the text material we have.
The Virginia Beach proposal looks very interesting, the detailed 
specifications are here:
http://www.vbgov.com/file_source/dept/cvd/Documents/OFCA-7-0002%20Complete%20RFP%20Package.pdf
Deadline for application is: May 18.

hi all,

a new sexy html controller is online.
check it out here:
http://www.1904.cc/~aether/control_panel2.html

it should be quite intuitive, the numbered arrows will make the images  
refresh at different speed (1=slow, 3=fast).
most of the frames are still void, waiting for your images to be uploaded.

to test realtime upload you can use the lastest version of the max  
patch (v.101), which you can find here:  
http://1904.cc/~aether/upload_101.pat.zip

or you can use the webcam2ftp software of your choice pointing to the  
following servers (from left to right and from top to bottom):

http://1904.cc/~aether/k/ (images named 0k.jpg - 9k.jpg)
http://1904.cc/~aether/l/ (images named 0l.jpg - 9l.jpg)
http://1904.cc/~aether/m/ (images named 0m.jpg - 9m.jpg)

http://10111.org/~aether/0/ (images named 0x.jpg - 9x.jpg)
http://10111.org/~aether/1/ (images named 0x.jpg - 9x.jpg)
http://10111.org/~aether/x/ (images named 0x.jpg - 9x.jpg)

if you use a webcam software that has a non-customisable naming  
scheme, tell me how the images are named and we will make a specific  
frame for this. btw we are still awaiting user reports about this two  
windows webcam softs:
http://lundie.ca/fwink/
http://www.webcam2000.info/

we could fix an appointment for this evening or some other day to do a  
sort of jam session...

it works beter at speed 2.
anyway there are only, maybe, 5 frames... i don't know, maybe 9...  
and i was trying to send 33 frames. to put it more fluide. not so  
interrupted. because we can not talk about movement or video. it is  
diaphorama. then we have to concive something to play the material  
this way.
unfortunaly we can not play with the "persistence retinnienne" in any  
way if things work like this.

hi, thanks for the comments,

indeed we could implement a version with a longer loop, like 33 frames.
the reason of having only 9 images is that there 
will be a quicker "live" refresh. with 33 images, 
you will cycle a lot through the same images 
before you see anything new.
but we have to test it.
also, for the persistance retinienne, i will try 
to build this hi-speed htmlpage.
but it seems also clear that at higher speeds, 
even the javascript-code isn't able to refresh 
the images correctly... still a trick has to be 
found

proposal for a jam session:
date: this friday, title: "electronic cafe international"
concept: broadcast from a café/ public location 
with internet access, using possibly a mobile 
computing device (of course exceptions are 
possible for locations where showing up publicly 
with a laptop would endanger your security..)
please send a mail to tell if you will 
participate, then i'll attribute the frames.

what's the best global performance time?
i propose this: 10 PM in europe = 1 PM in 
california = 3 PM in colombia = 6 AM in australia
(poor australia.. one hour later would be possible too..)

and btw a new patch is here: http://1904.cc/kode/upload_103.pat.zip
it works at a smaller size (the actual size at 
which the images are displayed on the web 
interface)
and there is a control of the speed of the video 
(can be useful to slow it down, to match the 
upload speed...)


best,
manuel

ok. bypass the refresh and the re-direct.
attached code to tell browser to get image every x mmseconds.
in the code here:
/* the magic call that tells the browser (window)
   to call the changeimage function every 1000ms (1 sec) */
    window.setInterval(changeimage, 1000);
the url of the photos on the server change for each square, these have to be changed in the code also. for now i have: "http://www.1904.cc/~aether/frame_k/0k.jpg" (0-9)

it has to be tested to see how many images the array can take, the buffer size, etc. if you give me the correct url for the photos i can do this... in any case, for now attached code (html + javascript only), comments are very explicative, curtosy of a mate...

Next message: [aether] Submitted Aether to 07/07/07 conference RE: aether news 
Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ] 

hi all,

busy week, in belgrade for a few days. but here 
are some thoughts, + some extracts of our recent 
chat chatter.


a) technical considerations

some explanations about the HTML interface:
open http://www.1904.cc/~aether/control_panel.html
click on "open mainframe"
try the different buttons:

mode 1,2,3 are cycling 10 images
(1: refresh every 4 seconds, 2: every second, 3: 5 frames per second)

in mode "33", 33 images are loaded and cycled at 
high speed (actually 8 images per second).
this speed couldn't be obtained if the page was 
refreshing each image everytime it's read. 
therefore, the images are refreshed at a much 
slower speed, 1 img per second.
so if the performer is transmitting, the loop 
will be changing very slowly over time.

[23:52] ideacritik: 33 is wild... but i get all the same images after a while.
[23:52] fe2cruz: it just takes a few seconds for the browser to catch up

in mode 1,2,3, each image is refreshed at the 
moment it is played. so this is closer to 
"realtime", but it also limits the speed at which 
the images can cycle.



b) general speed considerations:

[23:54] ideacritik: i think the speed change is a 
bit 'gadjetty' myself (though the 33 is certainly 
hilarious!)
[23:54] dspstv: 33 is far to much for what is 
being uploaded.. not enuf images to make a 
sentence
[23:54] dspstv: it loops to fast
[23:54] dspstv: imo
[23:55] ideacritik: 2 is ok.
[0:25] cym: the problem with speed 33 is that you must first have 33 images :-)
[0:25] cym: 33 images that sort of go together



c) GRID FORMAT: 6 or 9 frames

[0:27] fe2cruz: are we stuck with 6 for now? or 
can we jump back to 9 on the next jam test?
[0:28] ideacritik: it's just a question of adjusting the html page.
[0:28] ideacritik: not a big deal.
[0:28] cym: if there are 9 people that take part it should work?
[0:28] ideacritik: the 9 square grid was aesthetically pleasing.
[0:29] cym: i liked the 9 grid very much

Comment: 6 frames was really for testing only, 
with a one-screen computer it's much easier like 
that, when you need to share the screen between, 
the HTML frames, the chat, the upload software... 
9-frame setting should stay imo the standard for 
the actual performance.


d) the noble art of patching:

[0:17] fe2cruz: does anyone know how to write this patch for PD?
[0:18] boris_: not me.
[0:18] cym: i would like to have a look at it
[0:19] fe2cruz: can someone on MAX post screen 
captures of the patch? would that help at all?

no time for that this week, but more explanations 
about the inner workings of the patch will 
follow. also, i just discovered through the max 
list (thanks to a guy called vade who did an 
interesting webcam project: 
http://abstrakt.vade.info/?p=80 ) some techniques 
that could improve the receiving part of the 
patch significantly and eventually allow it to 
download the images fast and without crashing...


e) concept + content

[0:23] cym: i would be very interested to try to 
create a play, a story for those slow refreshing 
cameras
[0:23] dspstv: exactly
[0:23] cym: i actually like the idea that there 
is a new image only every second or even slower
[0:23] dspstv: agree
[0:23] fe2cruz: so is 33 just too much? too 
gittery should we keep it simple and stick with 1 
& 2 speeds?
[0:24] cym: with 9 cams in a grid it should be 
possible to create a nice effect, even when the 
changes are slow
[0:24] paulav: maybe
[0:25] paulav: il like the possibility of speeds, 
but if it doesnt work very good?

[0:51] boris_: yes, images are important and as 
cym was saying it would be good to work on some 
good script that would be playable by 6 (or 
better: 9) remoters and image per image... maybe 
packets of images , not necessarly in oreder 1 to 
33 but also a reset all function would be very 
usefull

Comment: yes, we need to develop some narrative 
outline. Concept proposal: GHOST STORY (Ghost 
Stories from Medellin, from the Californian 
desert, from the Austrian woods, from the Swiss 
heights..... we would also really need some 
Japanese or Korean ghost involved .. think Kairo).
Also with our 9-frame split-screen setup, maybe 
some inpiration could come from such 
split-narration epics as the Canterbury Tales, 
the Manuscript of Saragossa....


f) some more possible applications:
again very short term, if someone of you would 
have time and motivation to put together material 
for an application, would be great.

best,
manuel

hello all,

a friend of mine wrote a patch for pd last night that should do the
same thing as the max/jitter patch (upload images from the live webcam
stream to the server via ftp, naming them img1 to img33 and when they
reach 33 start again with img1).

if anyone of you is working with debian linux pd i can send the patch.
in general he would be interested to share and test the patch with
anyone.

also, he would be interested to join the jam session tomorrow.
his name is Nova Viator (or Luka Princic) and you can find more
information about him at

there is a workaround.

i'm attaching a modified patch. (02b)
no different names, no shell object. just one png
generated in /tmp/aether9.png

but uploading is done in separate terminal window with a 
long commandline like this:

ID=0; while (true); do if ((`expr $ID '>' 8`)); then ID=0; else ID=`expr $ID '+' 1`; fi; cat /tmp/aether9.png | ncftpput -u aether -p PASSWORD -c HOSTNAME $ID\x.png;  sleep 1; done

it's also in the patch, but you have to type it, so rather copypaste from here.

also change PASSWORD and HOSTNAME.

in the patch change [pdp_noise] to whatever else you want.
there is also a [receive] object - [r aetherone] so you can send video signals from some other opened patch with a send object like this: [s aetherone]

sleep 1 means wait one second (+ time it needs to upload). you can adjust this.



hope it helps

hi group,

a short message to inform you that a new performance patch is available:
http://www.1904.cc/~aether/kode/max_image_upload/

i finally added some functions i was planning since a long time, most 
importantly an "archiving" function:

as soon as you start uploading images, the patch will automatically 
store an image, ca. once per minute, on a specific server location
(for now it's http://www.cave12.org/~aether/archive/ )

this will allow us to have an image data-bank of our performances, 
which will be ready for many interesting uses.

however i could borrow some smart phones from this friend that does the
treasuremapper. also if we are serious about the phone idea i could meet
him (here in NL) and see if he thinks his thing can merge with ours and
how complicated it is technically (i.e. is it feasible to
achieve/implement in the berlin week).

otherwise i have no experience with such things... but always willing to
learn of course!! so let me know if i should suss out the situation.

[shell] is buggy, i can tell from personal experience but just read

other suggestions could use pdlua or pyext. it all depends how simple

it plagued us in lebanon and really killed the final minutes of berlin.

did we just have too many people viewing the website for Berlin?
I'm assuming this is the root of the problem.

i was able to stream only after restarting max and then deleting the
dummy (0kb) images that were writing incorrectly on our servers.
but this would only fix it for a minute. There would be write
errors immediately after. This was happening to those trying to
fix the locked hand and credits frames at the end of our performance.
There must be some way to verify the capacity of our servers and
anticipate the number of viewers we have for each performance.

the patch does give a red light and an 'error writing image" message.
however, there must be a way to prevent this from happening.

streaming for me worked fine during rehearsals when no one was viewing
the webpage. But it seems like now that we have a good audience
its impossible to perform because you can't stream when too many
people are viewing the interface website. It seems all of our
servers chrash during the performance from too much traffic.
Is my assumption correct? If not there must be some other way
to correct these upload issues during our performances. It can't
be on my end as my isp was not having any problems.

we have some time before manuel's & vinny's shows. We should really
try to correct this issue before then.
