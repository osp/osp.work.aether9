With regard to finances, the credit system is really well thought out - can it be automated, so that no one has to administer the system?! (none of us wants to be the aether accountant...)

read the publication PDF - i really enjoyed it. partially nostalgia of course, but i really appreciate how the tech discussion is interwoven with script/concept discussion and also occasional absurdities. these processes cannot be clearly divided (or categorised seperately as such) and i think it comes out wonderfully in this chat (also there is a nice culmination to the performance - whilst being an anticlimax).

one of the things i have always liked the most about aether is its non-slick, stop-motion like and pixelated aesthetic. for me this challenges many important hypes:
-the constant 'newness' of new media (higher speed, more pixels, faster cpus, etc)
-the ever higher resolution (which in the end is simply not accessible for most of the world which is also an important aether9 concern)
and most importantly misguided idea that these things contribute to the value of the message.

It feels like we are more in a digestive moment of our culture of images, narrative, questioning simultaneity in the global world, the real output is not yet there.
It feels also we are squeezed between the contradiction of doing real experimentation and being entertaining.

The idea is that the girls become ascii as they are eaten and in the 
stomach of the wolf / in a private show.
