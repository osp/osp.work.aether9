hi Aethers ..

Sunday is ideal time for a meeting / checks / rehearsal .. [ please ,  
even if some of you are available ]

Monday performance in Adelaide , we are on at 8.30pm Adelaide time  
and play till 9.30 pm  , ie

Adelaide (Australia - South Australia) Monday, December 7, 2009 at  
8:30:00 PM
Brussels : Monday, December 7, 2009 at 11:00:00 AM

please calculate your local times .. checks will start earlier ..

So far the tests i have done , with the wi fi available in the venue  
[ 1-3 Mb - bandwidth ] and mobile broadband/ USB modem  ( varies but  
often less than equal to 1Mb bandwidth ) ... " Slow is the word .. "

I will be using 3 computers in Adelaide with individual internet  
connections ..

1) Projecting Aethers interface :  i would suggest , please remove  
the audio stream .. Atleast for the interface that we use to stream  
in venue . At the moment , whats streaming on 1904.cc , takes long  
time to playback images properly .. there is a long buffering time ..
For me in Sydney , its totally fine , because i am on 15Mb+ bandwidth ..
For online audience we can make an interface that consists of all the  
content < which needs faster internet ..

2) To playback my AUDIO[ Syd]  in Adelaide  : What are your  
suggestions , i can use Ustream , Live stream or icecast/ Giss Tv  
setup using pd  ..
What you suggest ?

3) Stream AV from the performance space in Adelaide

I will write you more soon , please reply, your thoughts n  
suggestions . Sometime today i will send invites  .. people in  
adelaide are excited and it has been advertised properly over there ..

i have been spending way too much time at work , so apologies for not  
writing much , i read all your emails , and maintain the circuit of  
thoughts , inside me ..

Talk to you all soon , beautiful friends ..

Hi all,
for the Adelaide performance in a couple of hours, some important points:

* the frameset has been modified -- i removed the two "weak servers", nr
4 and 5, that we struggled with during the berlin performance. at the
moment i write this, those frames should show black, with an occasional
red or blue monochrome appearing.

If you recently accessed 1904.cc, you might use this direct link to make
sure your browser doesn't show you an old version:
http://1904.cc/live/frameset_09_adelaide/

* this means of course that i updated the server-list, included with the
Max patch -- the new list is included with the newest patch, nr 400.

You find it here:
http://1904.cc/~aether/kode/max_image_upload/

The password of the z7/rar archive is the "old" aether password, the one
that's easier to remember.

Meet you in 10 hours:)


Best,
Manuel

[aether] report: Adelaide performance + future

Hi all,

Some short report about the Adelaide performance, to which the Aether9
team contributed:

The project was coordinated by Vinny Bhagat (aka Shivnakaun), who was
streaming live electro-acoustics from his studio in Sydney (transmitting
through giss.tv from a PureData patch).

The stream was (supposedly, I didn't hear it) accompanied live
on-location in Adelaide (at The Wheatsheaf Hotel, 39 George St
Thebarton) by Kym Gluyas on saxophone. The aether9 interface was
projected and visible to the live audience.

The Aethernauts who generated the visuals:
Christiaan Cruz, Dhanya Pilo, ideacritik, Manuel Schmalstieg, Maria Fava

This was the first participation in the aether9 project for Maria Fava
(aka eskoitaus), located in Nice (N3krozoft members will remember her
from the CeC festival last February, where she was VJing).

The visuals were fully improvised. The performers decided to restrict
themselves to a black/white color palette for better graphic coherence.
Also, due to the little number of Aethernauts, only 4-5 frames of the
interface were used.

We didn't encounter any technical / upload speed issues this time.
Except ideacritik who was still unable to upload to frame 5, although
the server feeding this frame has been changed. Very mysterious.
