>audrey, more details about the upcoming 26th october event?
>is it confirmed?

yes yes confirmed! who can participate? how many squares shalll we have?<
i like laure`s idea of concentrating on aether and have tesla as a 'guest' (visited by aether). 
is our mailing list closed? or open? so nicola can join and keep up with conversations upcoming event.

we are trying to find someone to do the music-audio ... the idea i mentionned about streaming audio from there, to participants, and back into the room... no one confirmed thus far. do we have a backup audio streamer available - i know boris and laure are in transit so not available...

i`m off to a chalet for a couple of days, more upon return.

so who?s in???

Hi everybody!

I'm ready for the performance.
I just download the last patch. Need to know which location i have to  
choose, which frame. i used the 3rd one and the 6th. Are we finally  
going to use three frames par person? or now how are we going to  
work, now with nicolas participation.

i loved the cyber bear!

so, the script and everything will be at the same link i supposed.

will connect today to skype to see if we can try things up.

other thing, the sound streeming... i would like to try. it will be  
using giss tv?

ok.
see you soon on the net.

hey aethers, I am watching right now... waiting for the start
the interface looks very nice, but when I use firefox the sound
doesn't play (probably i am missing some plugin, but i keep it that
way for testing)
so i am watching the performance in explorer where the sound works fine.

but in explorer all the frames have a border! and because of the
border each cell has a scrollbar! and this doesn't look very nice. I
always have to resize the window to make the frame cells so big that
the scroll bar disappears. but the borders stay, so this effect that
it looks like the vertical lines on the top and bottom are connected,
disappears...

i just spent the whole week in ljubljana teaching 18 students
HTML/webdesign (from 10am till 21pm every day..), so maybe i am
focused a bit too much on such details, but anyway.. the interface
looks really nice in firefox and would be good if it looks the same in
explorer...

anyway, i am right now watching, waiting for the performance to start.
some of my students also said they will watch tonight, so it would be
good to put some message or something online, that performance is
starting 30 mins later. I am not sure if it is enough just that the
number of seconds how long to wait keeps on changing. would be better
to put a line on the bottom that says
* performance will start 30 mins later - 22:30 CET *

okay, i will keep on watching and waiting and take some photos
