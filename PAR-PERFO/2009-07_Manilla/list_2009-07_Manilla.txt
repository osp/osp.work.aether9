[aether] ASEUM epilogue

Don't fret ChloÃ©,

Manuel experienced the brunt of the term "Filipino Time"
Its an island mentality where things always seem to start
go or arrive later than proposed or expected. I had figured
this would happen so I did not want to burden everyone with
rehearsals and other meetings.

I've been on chat with Tengal since the festival and
everything seems to have worked out for the best. It
really was the biggest international symposium in that
lower region of Asia every assembled and Aether was
a big part of it. All the weird technical communications
issues and lack of proper funding aside it really was
a Success for the region. I have been involved in
earlier symposiums where they were not much more
than a website and mailing list. This one had real
events and exchanges.

They had lots of fun listening to Manuel do his presentation.
Even though we had communications issues and we started
slow the large audience still did enjoy listening to Manuel
count backwards. All those Filipino artists and students
hardly ever hear European accents. Its always Hollywood/TV
american english.

So maybe we could all go to the Philippines in the flesh
next year with any new Grant money? I go there regularly
so I wouldn't need a ticket. I'm sure that free housing
would be available then too.

Also sincere apologies to Vinny who was streaming to
dead frames 7-9. We will be sure to Specify that those
cells are not working when we use the SEXTET. maybe we
could create a warning or flag in the Patch.

Thanks to everyone that participated via streaming and or
just piping in on the list.

now on to -> Berlin & then cimatics?
