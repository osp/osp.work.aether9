[aether] correct spelling, names etc?

Hello,

Sorry for not being able to skype lately. Could someone write a short, 
simple summary about the actions done simultaneously? I won't be able to 
see or hear you due to the slow internets and this would help. There was 
something about luck in group changes and then there was something about 
sunset? I'll be able to stream a little bit about the sunset, it is 
setting behind the trees around the time of the my stream. I can of 
course try to climb on the roof of the house (a bit scared about that). 
What is the idea with the sunset? Is it about just showing a sunset what 
ever way we feel like or is there some sort of concept like everyone is 
trying to show it from same angles or something?

mkk

Mari & all the Aethers,

To make it easier I think rather than luck they mean: Chance

Props of luck gambling or chance ect:
Dice
drawing lots - sticks
throwing bones
games of chance
play
gaming imagery
Aethers Aleatoric

synchronization will also happen by chance
hopefully we can work with you via skype
otherwise we can also text your phone messages SMS
we can instruct you to add colors or adjust your stream
simple instructions like its too busy or a cooler or warmer color
likewise if skype is too much for your connection you may SMS me too
213-806-6962
free via http://www.gizmosms.com/

we'll have 1 person in each group function like a moderator
and try to keep all of the cells even and balanced

sunset/sunrise is just another way to accent our locations
if the trees are in your way don't climb your roof
its not important as not many of us won't have a sunrise or sunset
just have a local paper, a clock or snow
anything live from your location that the rest of us won't have

It seems like a proper rehearsal may be difficult to organize.
too many timezones. However since this is a festival about
imporvisation and our main theme could be
 Moving Images of Chance
then rehearsals may actually be the wrong thing to do.

I suggest all streamers just gather as many objects that they can.
Objects that might support or even oppose the idea of Chance.
Lots of Colors, pictures, books. Be prepared to write or Draw.
Have prisms, Kaliedescopes or lenses to put over your camera.
Try puppets in lights or just as shadows.
Use mirrors to open up your space.
Be aware of the other features available in the patch: cam-links & effects
have your camera near a nice window to grab imagery outside
or even stream outside in a nice location as long as the light isn't an issue

Everyone has at least 2 hours. So we should all bring lots of things
to play with in front of the camera and be ready to change those things
if your moderator feels your cell needs to be adjusted. Anywone with
luck enough to have connections for proper viewing and listening of
all the streams should try to communicate to everyone how all 9 cells
are working and if any adjustments need to be made.

*Those are my notes about the content of saturday's jam *:
playing cards
about luck : being lucky (can lead to any personal interpretation)
clocks (time zone, time on location)

following the music : improvising on the music.

abstract lines ...

Nature Weightless Wet Anxious Travel
Hot Languid Food Soft Money Couples/Pairs

Focal Shift
NECESSITY TO PREPARE DIFFERENT KIND OF PROPS, ACCORDING TO THE SUBJECT.
I would like to add that the mutual watching of other frames should not be
forgotten, so that we really play together (if there is no master of
ceremony). Maybe some frames could also be passive or still, or showing a
slow minimalistic action, in order to llow other frames to catch the viewers
attention. Let's consider each other as an orchestra and trully imagine what
it sounds like when all musicians are playing solo in the same time...
by the way, is there a leader of the performance or not ?!
See you soon

SET UP AND EQUIPEMENTS IN MEDELLIN for streaming and projection.

1. Two screens (one for skype chat and patch the other for MAIN AETHER  
WINDOW)
2. Two projectors.
3. Sound transmission   (i would like to know MANU, if that sound  
patch i'm using could have a doble transmission to another channel  
where quality could be maximum as Chris proposed?)

http://giss.tv:8000/aether.mp3

4. Video channels transmission:

RECORDING.
Who will record the hole performance?
We should maybe asign different people for different moments.. it will  
be long!

Who will record sound?
who will record video?

I will try to do it here, but ... cool if someonelse do it.
one at cd quality and the other really low


IDEAS for JAM we talked in last chats

At 2:00 pm (COL time) we will try to start at time with this jam

CYM gives the signal, in a moment of *highter intensity* will start.  
Just need to be sure everyone is clear and knows they must write  
"greetings to split" when Cym gives that command around 20minutes into  
our performance

and then 'greetings to split', in different languages.
(Like, projection in Croatia. Videovortex Festival. Cym, hello from  
Vorva Linda, California, Here  is the sun in Australia, C'est le  
printemps à Brusels,...


1.Playing cards, dice, coins, casino...
about luck : being lucky --> astrology, karma
clocks.  could be a nice "leitmotiv", a clock , like an old alarm. to  
use it in BREAKS.

We say the comand: CLOCKS and everyone put clocks in their frames.

2. Drawings, abstract lines, B&W

3. Ambience, landscapes, and using remote webcams.

4. Simulating people making, "Foley sound" . Crunching, steps, claps,  
hammers, using in the image objects that makes think about sound!

5. Simulating playing instruments, following music.

6.Adapting to less frames.

7.Words to play with:

Luck Nature    Weightless   Wet   Anxious   Travel
Hot   Languid   Food   Soft   Money   Couples/Pairs
Dance   Industrial   Ancient   Magic   Cool   Depth
Focal Shift

8. spaceships, tesla, transmision, theremyn... representation of  
magnetic fields..

9. Toys, objects, playhouse

10. try to play simon says.

11. use red, green, bleu patch colors, and contrast B&W images... some  
times of course colored and what ever you want of course....


THINK about a moment of a little perfomance for 30 minutes, to make  
muscicians do the soundtrack live.... (aether9 making images and  
muscicians following)



the interface with 9 frames
dissolve interface
  sometimes some of the frames black
abstract lines

the teams themselves can decide how to lay things out
hell they can move around in just one cell if they want too



IDEAS IN THE AIR of  posible STRUCTUREs FOR THE JAM
For the JAM I have being talking to musicians to see if they have an  
structure to follow. Because i think it is very nice to have knoledge  
of that to prepare something for aether9.

1. One of the musicians will base his part of the JAM direction  
working with SILENCE in music.
2. Another one will work with a synth and use, from the computer,  
algoritms like dinamic systems . That will not be repetitive sound  
secuences. Some could take a long time, others not.
random typical aether atmospheres

1. Writing in skype session , needs of noises, voices, music, strings,  
punctual "bruitage".
2. Using colors as we have being doing, in frames we want to have  
particulary "musicalised".Like in SIMON SAYS toy.
