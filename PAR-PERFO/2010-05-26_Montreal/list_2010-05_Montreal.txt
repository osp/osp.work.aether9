hi all,

i've been in contact with Eva Quintas president of agence TOPO where i
sent a proposal for an aether9 residency about a month ago. the current
proposal is the following: (it is still to be confirmed whether they
accept or not)

5 week residency ending with a performance at the 'geo-web installation'
festival at the Cinematheque.

theme: "lost in montreal"
this theme adresses the mobility of the actor (to be developped in
residency) and the aspect of discovery ('getting lost') linked to
cinematographic explorations of the avant-garde (esthetic). (wink wink
manu : )

schedule:

week 1-3: (audrey @ TOPO - other agents remotely present)
-PD patch development
-developemnt of mobile interface (method to control upload, contrast,
etc., actions with a WII contoller)
week 4-5: (audrey and chris @ TOPO - other agents remotely present)
-explorations and experimentation with mobile interface
-script
-performance

dates (approximate) : mid-may to mid-june 2010
place: montreal

this is perhaps a bad translation and certainly an abrieviated version
which does not convey the extremely fun aspect of this new prospect of
running around town with a magic wand uploading images to the interface.
in any case as soon as/if we have confirmation we'll get down to details.

I'll check it out again for sure. I had a lot of trouble with
purdyne on my laptop but that was years ago. It worked well,
but never got the resolution of my laptop's LCD right. It'll
be interesting to see what has happened since then, but
after we finish the Montreal project.

As an update to that:
I got a wiimote working to control PD on a Kubuntu laptop.
Audrey's got a functioning PDpatch running on her linux box.
We both have working webcams on pd within linux distros.
And everyone must put availablities into the PiratePad
and start contributing:

hi all,

chris and i are working our asses off (despite the beautiful beer drinking
terasse sitting weather taking over the city). the alpha alpha patch is
pretty much done - wii remote action up next. im half-way through the
script/scenario (will upload very soon). local actor jordan arseneault has
contributed loads to the script/scenario and i think it has tremendous
potential!

**rectification: may 26th showtime: 19h30CET this is confirmed!**

ps to answer the linux/osx question - we are working on linux exclusively
at the moment because we plan (in the future) to make a boot cd (that is
os independant, that everyone can use regardless of what operating system
they use). so those who want to try it out for now must have a linux
system and some patience to install other libraries and etc - or a
puredyne type boot cd (i havent tried this either). therefore it is
foreseeable that everyone else but the montreal crew ends up using the max
patch for the next gig :)

...that all folks! :) ...
