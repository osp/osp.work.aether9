create/record sound files yourself or find them from other websites
(with credits)

FTP your files here
http://cave12.org/~aether/archive/2010.03.26.Helsinki

just follow these guidelines:

Installation Sound Loop Guidelines
This is an 8+ hour Public installation so please select your audio files with
these things in mind:

1. Voice reading a text in narratively engaging tone. Can be an essay
about aether theories, or narrative. should be possible to
understand/follow.
2. Very short audio-loop of only a few seconds, that is interesting to
listen to when looping for 1-2 minutes (maybe with slight shift in
volume and speed). should not be too disruptive / rhythmic - it should
be usable as a background for a reading voice.
3. Avoid annoying sounds or standard crowd noise that would just blend
into a large room of talking people.
4. The content relates to the visual material we're streaming
(landscapes of us see below)
5. Ambient synthesizer or radio wave sounds in upper frequencies.


Examples:
space sounds - http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/space-audio/sounds/
aurora sounds - http://www.auroralchorus.com/
space radio - http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/sounds/sounds.htm


”LANDSCAPES OF US” (working title)

This idea is inspired somehow by Vimeo group called ”The Pictures
Don't Move” http://www.vimeo.com/groups/thepicturesdontmove and of
course Judy's idea about the leaves. Idea would be to create
landscapes or sceneries by using different streams: even though each
stream is different and from different location, together they create
a whole scenery (this is something Aether has done with drawing, I
guess, but now it would be live footage). It's pretty simple, here's a
sketch that explains a bit: http://www.artsufartsu.net/IMG_2438.JPG

But what would be the sceneries, then? Should there be one or more?
Could there be themes like, e.g, earth, wind, water and fire? Urban,
forest, countryside? What is nature anyways? It should just be your
localized nature. Like Judy's idea of shooting out your window. Just
pick some image in your area that you can safely stream the whole
8 hours. Or the aethernaut could have different setups say 8 different
1 hour landscapes. I like this change idea.

As of now the 9 aether frames will be like an exqusite corpes landscape image
the top three sky streams
the middle 3 frames horizon
and the lower 3 earth ground streams
A localized scene from your area is preferred


So far we have confirmed
Mari Keski-Korsu (possibly streaming in on location)

Christiaan Cruz
Manuel Schmalstieg
Judy Nylon
Paula Vélez Bravo
Cym

It'd be nice to 4 or more Aethernauts streaming live landscape
so ask Friends and family about availability on Friday March 26th Helsinki time
Just introduce them via the list and one of us can setup a skype chat date to
help them get used to using the patch if needed.

Hi,

Finally got info about set up in Kerava Art Museum. They start already 
in the morning at 8 am (CET), but there won't be electricity for two 
hours, so I think 10 - 11 am (CET) would be a good time for us to start 
testing our work. This is Thursday 25.3.

John Hopkins is interested in joining our installation. He would like to 
stream Arizona sunrise at 14:30-15:00, (30min) CET
Manu, from where should he download the needed files and also the server 
listing?

Hi
I missed some of the chats, but wanted to know how we have access to  
these other web cameras?
i see it on the patch, but it is some sort of piracy or web channels?
wow!

cheers,
Dhanya

Hi,

Manu, Paula, Audrey, Vinny, Cym, Judy, Chris, Dhanya and John.
Once more, THANK YOU very much for your hard work and amazing creation 
in Pixelache Camp yesterday. It was such a nice experience. I also want 
to apologise once more that I had difficulties on concentrating in 
between the virtual discussion of us and talking about the work with 
people in physical space. Both sides lack in this situation, that's for 
sure. But I hope you won't hate me, still :)

I uploaded some pics to my Flickr account, I will ad them to the Aether9 
group after Paula accepts me as a member of it.

Hello Mari

Thank you for uploading the photos. The festival looks very nice!
After seeing the photos I really think that it is a pity that I couldn't
come...
But it was a very nice experience to stream with Audrey from the garden. It
was so strange to walk around there in this very quiet garden next to a busy
street, making pictures from grass, water and clouds, while trying not to
loose the connection. Somehow it seemed very bizarre to me, especially to do
this live. But it is really nice to get feedback and to see some photos of
the installation with the audience. The setting, the projection inside the
white cube, is really nice!

Hi all,

big thanks to Mari for running the show at Camp Pixelache!

It was a very interesting perfo for me as i was testing a new streaming 
setup:
- little AsusEEE netbook (running the patch in WinXP)
- cheapo USB webcam (Aiptek VGA+)
- mobile USB web access

The first session was a near total failure, as it was raining heavily, 
and I realized that it's impossible to operate laptop+cam while holding 
an umbrella! In addition to that, the botanical garden where I was 
trying to stream from turned out to be in a no-network zone between two 
hills.

During the afternoon sessions, rain stopped, and I got used to the 
process of quickly connecting the USB modem, entering PIN, launching Max 
patch, adjusting cam settings, all in a couple of minutes. And as Cym 
says, it's a very weird and fascinating feeling, sending the live images 
from a quiet natural outside location.

The connection was surpraisingly stable, even in a rolling train there 
were no disconnections. It looks like switzerland has a dense coverage, 
appart from mountainous zones. This opens lots of opportunities for 
outside streaming, and I think the direction of "mobile documentary 
event coverage" is something to explore, where the "realtime" element 
can make real sense.

Also, specially in the later hours of the performance, I think we worked 
out a good sense of composition withing our 9 frames (in terms of 
geometry, colors)... hopefully the sign that there *is* some ongoing 
progress in our familiarity with the tool / framework :)

physical/virtual : )

i especially like:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/artsufartsu/4466814176/
(our new aether9 'do' ? :)

apart from the usual chaos of our performances i appreciated yesterday for
a few reasons. first of all it was nice to be perfoming for so long (some
hours) while people where casually walking in and out of the space (i
imagine) because this meant mkk was giving us 'live' feedback on what is
getting through to people. comments like - 'yes text helps' - or - 'add a
shot of your faces in the loop' - etc.

cym and i were indeed reflecting on what could possibly indicate to
viewers that this is live - it is otherwise just pleasant scenery. ideas
like adding the occasional mugshot, or the computer in 'the wild' are the
start of a list we should elaborate upon.

manu i loved your train and 'wandering' streaming! i also thought that
much of the sound that was streaming yesterday was such a huge improvement
on our tired sound bank. at one point the music coupled with the image was
so fitting - i had a moment - one of those randomly programmed ones...

next perfo coming april 21st in amsterdam - more on that soon.

more videos:
http://1904.cc/aether/2010/community-news/trains-forest/

i just pasted together a few clips that i had the good idea to record 
while streaming ...

do not forget: the patch *has the ability to record* with the little 
"rec" button under the preview window ... it creates small quicktime 
files that don't take much space on the harddrive, so you can record a 
lot ...

best,
m.
