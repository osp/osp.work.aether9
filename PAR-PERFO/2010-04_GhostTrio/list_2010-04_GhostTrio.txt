We're revealing our adaptation of  "Ghost Trio," by Beckett on  
Saturday December 15th. Written in 1975, taped in '76 and televised on  
BBC2 in 1977. It is a parallel universe played out in the same slice  
of time as the first wave of British punk. Beckett, I wish we'd met.

My fellow aethernauts and I would be delighted if you would join us  
live on-line at our first chance to bring this play from TV to a wider  
audience. It doesn't matter what you're wearing and you won't have to  
worry about how you're getting home.

Members of Aether9 will be performing from Medellin, Yorba Linda,  
NYC , Brussels, Geneva, and Paris. The audience, those in the same  
room, will be joined at 'Videomedja 2007' at the Museum of Vojvodina,  
Novi Sad, Serbia, by two Aether9 artists from Austria and Slovinia who  
will host the Q & A which follows the performance.

There are no complicated programs or hardware involved. It is easier  
than getting out of the house. I hope you will look through our site  
at  www.1904.cc where the collaborative process involved is quite  
transparent, our project laid out, and participants credited. Here we  
will make the links "to set up your computer" so easy that you will  
practically fall through them.

You will need to go through one link to find out what the time will be  
where you are, when it is Saturday at 11:15 PM in Serbia. The second  
link opens the audience viewing window and a third link leads to  
instructions to stream sound.

We all wait inside our distractions to see what is outside time,  
beyond words, without location, and never in complete control …….....

good afternoon,

yesterday immediately after the performance maaike (actress), cym and i
had to take everything down in less than 10min. this meant we had to
immediately shut down computers, beamers, etc.

some feedback from organisors:
-beautiful, 'it really worked for me' this kindof slow trance like medium.
(in short we are invited to develop something for museumnacht in november
- more on that in another email)
-maaike was a really great actress (i agree)

other feedback:
-it was really clear that it fell apart (timing, etc).
-interesting how you work with a form (telematic performance) that was
explored in pre-days of internet and then some how dropped out.

for my part i would like to thank you all for participating in this
unpaid, unexpectedly very demanding, and extremely chaotic performance (+
rehearsals). it was not easy - thanks for hanging in there!!! the
performance was certainly not a great success (timing was pretty off) but
considering the chaos and the single rehearsal we did quite all right.
amsterdam was pretty solid thanks to the script with timing. this
countered the lack of timing in the interface.

i think we are at some sort of a x-road. there have been many tensions
mounting, namely: diverging ideas about the future of aether9, possible
directions, where to invest energy, time, etc.

i think it is time to organise a chat meeting in which these things can be
discussed. i myself have many issues and frustrations with this group at
the moment which need to be adressed (especially in light of the upcoming
residency). i think the mailing-list is not the place to do this. the fact
that misscommunication cannot be immediately addressed in a chat channel
can lead to huge unnecessary tensions. i suggest a meeting over the
weekend. late enough that columbia/california dont have to again wake up
before 7am!

so suggestions?
saturday or sunday evening? (lets say 21:00CET?)

lets please keep this discussion off list. after all it is 'public'.
