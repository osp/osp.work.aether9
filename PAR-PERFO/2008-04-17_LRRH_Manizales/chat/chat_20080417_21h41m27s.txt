Apr 15 21:49:20 -christel- [Global Notice] Hi all! As you are aware we're preparing to move to a new Services package -- thanks to the hard work from the Atheme guys, in particular jilles (and nenolod) we are now ready for you all to come help us make sure they're approaching ready for production! Please join us over at the testnet. Connect to irc.freenode.net on port 9001. Thank you and have a great day!
Apr 15 21:50:05 <aether9> alejo, you are still there?
Apr 15 21:52:00 <aleij> half brother
Apr 15 21:52:20 <aether9> ok. you talked about coming to geneva for saturday?
Apr 15 21:52:37 <aleij> i was wondering
Apr 15 21:52:39 <aleij> but
Apr 15 21:52:50 <aleij> think is to late to find prems
Apr 15 21:52:52 <aleij> :S
Apr 15 21:53:00 <aether9> but you're in aix-en-provence now, right?
Apr 15 21:53:12 <aleij> yes
Apr 15 21:53:31 <aleij> thats why i say prems, those cheapo TGV tickets
Apr 15 21:53:40 <aether9> anyway most work has to be done beforehand..
Apr 15 21:53:57 <aleij> that means?
Apr 15 21:54:02 <aleij> thursday?
Apr 15 21:54:38 <aether9> those next days.. we will see how boris and i handle the tasks
Apr 15 21:54:54 <aether9> and which computer is doing the sound streaming...
Apr 15 21:55:01 <aether9> but it should be ok
Apr 15 21:55:01 <aleij> ahh oke, so your not alone
Apr 15 21:55:27 <aleij> cool
Apr 15 21:55:34 <aether9> yes, we will handle it.. was just asking in case you wanted to come anyway
Apr 15 21:56:15 <aleij> for me it makes sense to go to work on aether, otherwise i try to follow online
Apr 15 21:57:23 <aether9> yes... btw i saw you'll be in basel soon, will try to come and see
Apr 15 21:57:23 <aleij> did you saw the log 
Apr 15 21:57:29 <aether9> the log?
Apr 15 21:57:32 <aleij> paula says
Apr 15 21:57:41 <paula> holo
Apr 15 21:57:45 <aether9> ah, the sound-patch problems
Apr 15 21:57:47 <paula> no veia que llamabas
Apr 15 21:57:47 <aleij> that one she opens the uploading patch sounds breaks
Apr 15 21:58:08 <aleij> seems the runtime cant handle both things at the same time
Apr 15 21:58:49 <aether9> ok.. so either we use another streaming tool, or another computer
Apr 15 21:59:02 <aether9> which would anyway be a more robust solution
Apr 15 21:59:09 <aleij> agree
Apr 15 21:59:18 <paula> it could be done with another computer then
Apr 15 21:59:19 <aether9> the upload patch is not 100% crash-resistant...
Apr 15 21:59:21 <aleij> paula, how much ram has that machine?
Apr 15 21:59:26 <paula> my assistant have a mac
Apr 15 21:59:32 <aether9> and the musician?
Apr 15 21:59:41 <aether9> could he stream his sound directly?
Apr 15 21:59:52 <paula> yeah
Apr 15 21:59:54 <aleij> theres also nicecast
Apr 15 22:00:06 <paula> he has another computer also
Apr 15 22:00:21 <paula> he is playing live music, not laptop music
Apr 15 22:00:30 <aether9> ah, great
Apr 15 22:00:35 <paula> but we can use his computer to transmit i think
Apr 15 22:00:58 <aether9> a software that seems simple enough is Muse - i guess you know it alejo?
Apr 15 22:01:20 <aleij> yes, but im not sure about os x version
Apr 15 22:01:24 <aleij> i think is old
Apr 15 22:01:39 <aleij> for the macbooks
Apr 15 22:01:42 <aether9> maybe...
Apr 15 22:02:06 <aleij> i have a pd patch but 
Apr 15 22:02:09 <aether9> you're right, it's PPC
Apr 15 22:02:18 <aleij> with the second machine your patch will do
Apr 15 22:02:28 <aleij> second machine is the solution
Apr 15 22:02:35 <aleij> as you said
Apr 15 22:03:02 <aether9> yes, maybe a bit a pain to install the runtime + objects, but it should work
Apr 15 22:03:03 <aleij> more stable
Apr 15 22:03:10 <aleij> ahh ok
Apr 15 22:03:11 <paula> the musician has a mac powerbook
Apr 15 22:03:42 <aleij> could be also, puredata and one patch i have or easier nicecast
Apr 15 22:04:19 <aether9> that makes four possibilities ;)
Apr 15 22:04:24 <paula> you asked me, alejo: how much ram has that machine? which one?
Apr 15 22:04:32 <aleij> both :)
Apr 15 22:04:43 <aleij> manuel nice if you come to basel
Apr 15 22:04:50 <aleij> we will be with lorenz schori
Apr 15 22:05:01 <aether9> i think any powerbook should be able to send an mp3 stream, no?
Apr 15 22:05:07 <aleij> yes
Apr 15 22:05:29 <aleij> it was more to be sure one could also have hungry pd
Apr 15 22:05:49 <paula> 2.16 GHz intel core duo.  2GB 667 Mhz DDR2.  
Apr 15 22:06:14 <paula> mine
Apr 15 22:06:24 <aleij> you have pd already im sure
Apr 15 22:06:53 <paula> but Natalia's puter is less strong, dont know exacly the ram
Apr 15 22:07:07 <paula> i have pd
Apr 15 22:07:10 <paula> yes
Apr 15 22:07:19 <paula> but i have never use it
Apr 15 22:08:05 <paula> i tryed the patch aether send once, but it crashed, i didnt know very well hoow it worked
Apr 15 22:08:31 <aether9> so it will take some time to get used.. probably the max patch is most simple solutions, since all the settings are already included
Apr 15 22:08:48 <paula> so, the thing is: i must transmit sound from one laptop. instal runtime, patch and everything
Apr 15 22:09:09 <aether9> yep, that seems the thing to do.
Apr 15 22:09:19 <paula> the problem is:  my assitant and muscian arrives almost 1 hour before workshop starts
Apr 15 22:09:35 <paula> so it will not be a lot of time to install things
Apr 15 22:10:07 <aether9> yes.. but so you can show to the people of the workshop how to install things :)
Apr 15 22:10:07 <paula> and they are in medellin working for a concert tomorrow, so i don t think theey have time to work on it on line
Apr 15 22:10:31 <paula> yeah!
Apr 15 22:10:41 <aleij> haha
Apr 15 22:10:52 <aleij> paula, anyway lets try the pd option
Apr 15 22:10:53 <paula> i must make a CD with all the necesary stuff
Apr 15 22:10:54 <aether9> in the worst case, somebody from the workshop participants will do the soundstream, for example
Apr 15 22:11:03 <aleij> the patch i have is friendly
Apr 15 22:11:18 <paula> can you make me a list to no make mistakes? 
Apr 15 22:11:35 <aether9> for PD or for Max?
Apr 15 22:11:36 <aleij> give me the mountpoint and password so i can "hard code" that into it so its even easier
Apr 15 22:11:39 <aleij> pd
Apr 15 22:12:07 <paula> great alejo, i'm exited about tryin g pd
Apr 15 22:12:21 <aether9> easyer but impossible to copy to another computer
Apr 15 22:12:26 <paula> then maybe i could stream sound with it
Apr 15 22:12:29 <aleij> she will only need to double click on it and select the sound input
Apr 15 22:12:31 <paula> at the same time
Apr 15 22:12:37 <paula> and is freeware
Apr 15 22:12:44 <paula> better than max because of that
Apr 15 22:12:49 <aether9> of course
Apr 15 22:13:10 <aleij> whats the password for aether.mp3 ?
Apr 15 22:13:24 <aether9> one sec
Apr 15 22:13:54 <aleij> we can test, is fast, you have pd already so nothing to loose
Apr 15 22:13:57 <aleij> just my time
Apr 15 22:13:59 <aleij> :)
Apr 15 22:14:29 <aether9> passwd qs39z
Apr 15 22:14:30 <aleij> i need to finish up some formulaire for felipe cesar
Apr 15 22:14:32 <aleij> tx
Apr 15 22:14:38 <aether9> connect giss.tv aether.mp3 8000
Apr 15 22:14:45 <aleij> yeap
Apr 15 22:15:20 <aether9> was streaming at mpeg 44100 40kbps
Apr 15 22:15:35 <aether9> mono
Apr 15 22:18:28 <aleij> ok
Apr 15 22:18:40 <aleij> give some minutes
Apr 15 22:23:48 <paula> ok. i will wait, you just tell me when we are testing
Apr 15 22:24:41 <aether9> in the meantime, paula, you can watch a nice webcam video i made last night: http://blip.tv/file/828741
Apr 15 22:26:29 <paula> thats great!
Apr 15 22:26:49 <paula> did you animated faster all the uploaded frames?
Apr 15 22:26:59 <paula> that is the snow?
Apr 15 22:27:11 <aether9> yes, it's in southern sibiria..
Apr 15 22:27:12 <paula> or there is an extra layer
Apr 15 22:27:13 <paula> ?
Apr 15 22:27:29 <paula> i love it
Apr 15 22:27:29 <aether9> no special effects ;)
Apr 15 22:27:39 <paula> encore mieux
Apr 15 22:27:52 <aether9> the speed is just the speed of the webcam, but played at 25 frames/second
Apr 15 22:28:24 <paula> coll
Apr 15 22:28:29 <paula> coooool
Apr 15 22:28:40 <paula> [:) 
Apr 15 22:29:01 <aether9> thnx :]
Apr 15 22:29:25 <paula> and how did you capture the camera? 
Apr 15 22:29:56 <aether9> avec un patch, qui se trouve aussi sur notre serveur de download, nommé "better than tv" ...
Apr 15 22:30:48 <paula> ahhh j. i will test it one of this days
Apr 15 22:31:08 <aether9> yes you should ;)
Apr 15 22:31:52 <paula> i was writing a emaid for you. alors je vais profiter pour t'envoyer par ici les questions
Apr 15 22:32:12 <paula> you toldme:
Apr 15 22:32:12 <paula> for the workshop, it would be best probably to use the 
Apr 15 22:32:12 <paula> "test-interface" that is included in each patch folder.
Apr 15 22:32:27 <paula> and i say: The test interface only has one frame and it will be cool if there are 9 frames for this.
Apr 15 22:32:38 <aether9> it has nine frames!
Apr 15 22:32:44 <aether9> open mainframe.html
Apr 15 22:33:34 <aether9> je veux dire: frameset.html
Apr 15 22:34:04 <paula> http://1904.cc/~aether/html/mainframe.html
Apr 15 22:34:27 <paula> http://1904.cc/~aether/html/frameset.html
Apr 15 22:34:30 <aether9> non, le frameset n'est pas en ligne: il faut ouvrir celui qui se trouve dans le dossier du patch
Apr 15 22:34:40 <paula> ahhh
Apr 15 22:35:04 <aether9> (ceci dit, je pourrais bien sur le mettre en ligne aussi.. mais c'est prévu pour l'usage "privé", disons)
Apr 15 22:36:04 <paula> je ne vois pas tell objet dans le dossier du patch... :s
Apr 15 22:36:18 <aether9> dans le dossier "sample_HTML"
Apr 15 22:36:25 <aether9> qui se trouve dans le dossier du patch
Apr 15 22:36:35 <aleij> almost there, need to fine tune the metadata
Apr 15 22:36:53 <aether9> cool!
Apr 15 22:36:57 <paula> yea
Apr 15 22:37:02 <aleij> what aether9 url we use?
Apr 15 22:37:08 <aleij> the direct or the other
Apr 15 22:37:11 <aether9> for?
Apr 15 22:37:24 <aleij> for the metadata entry of the stream
Apr 15 22:37:39 <aether9> ah.. 1904.cc/aether/
Apr 15 22:37:45 <aleij> so it appears in VLC nicely
Apr 15 22:37:46 <aether9> or 1904.cc
Apr 15 22:37:47 <aleij> ok
Apr 15 22:37:52 <aleij> i have that one
Apr 15 22:38:06 <aleij> so i leave that one
Apr 15 22:38:14 <aleij> the main page
Apr 15 22:38:15 <aether9> anyway, it will not be visible in the web interface
Apr 15 22:38:36 <aleij> the stream is public and annouced via GISS
Apr 15 22:38:46 <aleij> i work for GISS :)
Apr 15 22:38:49 <aleij> is cleaner
Apr 15 22:38:51 <aether9> ah, nice you took the time to do this
Apr 15 22:38:55 <aether9> of course
Apr 15 22:39:03 <aleij> nice you are in IRC :)
Apr 15 22:39:27 <aether9> yeah, finally.. my skype user message now points to the irc channel..
Apr 15 22:39:43 <aether9> but you should teach us some basic things..
Apr 15 22:40:08 <aether9> like how channel creation, admin status and that kind of stuff works
Apr 15 22:41:00 <aether9> i also found now good settings for xchat to create nice logfiles, so that last obstacle has disappeared
Apr 15 22:41:19 <paula> so now the main window works with vlc and not flash?
Apr 15 22:41:51 <aether9> no, vlc is still not a very widespread plugin
Apr 15 22:41:56 <paula> i dont understand
Apr 15 22:42:10 <aether9> so we can simply use VLC if we want to test, or the have a better sound, or a more reliable player
Apr 15 22:42:40 <aether9> but the "internet audience" will listen to the same stream through the flash player integrated in the web page
Apr 15 22:43:06 <paula> this?
Apr 15 22:43:07 <paula> http://giss.tv:8000/aether.mp3
Apr 15 22:43:13 <paula> it doesnt work
Apr 15 22:43:37 <aether9> it works when the stream is working... most of the time it works..
Apr 15 22:43:52 <aether9> the little flash player reads exactly the same stream
Apr 15 22:44:17 <paula> ah, ok
Apr 15 22:44:31 <aether9> (but with a worse sound quality, because it's flash)
Apr 15 22:45:07 <paula> well now that i have this frameset open
Apr 15 22:45:34 <aether9> you will ask me why the test frameset doesnt have the sound player...
Apr 15 22:45:36 <paula> how can i use the test for transmision?
Apr 15 22:46:04 <aether9> simply, there are two different server lists.
Apr 15 22:46:18 <aether9> one for the "performance servers", one for the "test servers"
Apr 15 22:46:20 <paula> no, je suis en train de revenir au sujet precedent
Apr 15 22:46:51 <aether9> so - sound transmission?
Apr 15 22:47:03 <paula> ok, so, this one for the test servers is not online cause it is for private Test Use
Apr 15 22:47:21 <aether9> the servers are online, but the interface is not
Apr 15 22:47:31 <paula> so for the workshop are we going to use this frame? but it is not online
Apr 15 22:47:55 <paula> ah, the servers are online 
Apr 15 22:47:58 <paula> ok
Apr 15 22:48:14 <aether9> the idea is: anybody could use any kind of servers
Apr 15 22:48:22 <paula> so it will be a link for remote aether team
Apr 15 22:48:28 <aether9> the interface has simply to point to this servers
Apr 15 22:49:09 <paula> ok , so which patch i have to use for the workshop?
Apr 15 22:49:19 <aether9> the patch is the same
Apr 15 22:49:31 <paula> and i use the test frame
Apr 15 22:49:39 <aether9> simply, the server.txt file (server list) is different
Apr 15 22:49:42 <paula> for everyone?
Apr 15 22:50:27 <paula> i'm following your mail, give me a second , i dont want to make you repeate everything
Apr 15 22:50:36 <paula> then i will ask you if i dont understand
Apr 15 22:50:41 <aether9> ok
Apr 15 22:52:07 <aether9> the basic thing is: when you open the patch, it will look for a file called "servers.txt", and create the menu of servers from the content of that file.
Apr 15 22:52:41 <aether9> so you can decide if you want to use the "performance servers", or the "workshop servers"
Apr 15 22:52:54 <aether9> the "performance servers" are secret, password-protected
Apr 15 22:53:10 <aether9> the "workshop servers" are totally public
Apr 15 22:53:45 <aether9> they are contained in the "servers-example.txt" file, which is not encrypted
Apr 15 22:53:48 <aleij> ok paula
Apr 15 22:53:57 <aleij> check email
Apr 15 22:54:11 <aether9> one moment, paula can't do so many things at the same time;)
Apr 15 22:54:20 <aleij> still some error with the metadata, but is not relevant now
Apr 15 22:54:25 <paula> yes, thanks manu, i undestand now..... otherway .tell me .also  the sound patch has to be in the same folder as the main patch? maybe this is not working because of this. did you tried already your patch streaming sound and image at the same time? j'ai l'impression d'avoir reusir a le faire dj une fois.
Apr 15 22:54:39 <aleij> yes, she filled up my mailbox in the meantine
Apr 15 22:54:53 <paula> ahjajajaja thats true
Apr 15 22:55:10 <paula> i'm mail bombing aethernautes
Apr 15 22:55:39 <aether9> paula, the sound patch is totally different, it doesn't matter where you put it
Apr 15 22:56:00 <aether9> i did image and sound streaming at the same time without problem
Apr 15 22:56:10 <aether9> but it's not a good idea to do it during performance
Apr 15 22:56:19 <paula> ok
Apr 15 22:56:22 <aether9> the image patch can crash during performance
Apr 15 22:56:33 <paula> ok
Apr 15 22:56:36 <aether9> it's not a bit problem, because you can restart fast.
Apr 15 22:56:45 <aether9> but if the sound interrupts, it's a problem
Apr 15 22:57:09 <aether9> because probably people don't know they have to restart the sound player...
Apr 15 22:57:36 <aether9> so... better to use two different softs, or two different computers
Apr 15 22:58:06 <aether9> if you use PD, be sure to test if it works 30 min without crash
Apr 15 22:58:08 <paula> i START pd
Apr 15 22:58:12 <aether9> yeah!
Apr 15 22:58:39 <aleij> yes, lets test that and crash paulas compi with pd!!
Apr 15 22:59:06 <paula> am i transmiting now?
Apr 15 22:59:20 <aleij> you have down
Apr 15 22:59:26 <aleij> a status
Apr 15 22:59:29 <paula> yes, 
Apr 15 22:59:35 <paula> status?
Apr 15 22:59:40 <aether9> one thing beforehand (alejo maybe forgets because it's natural to him), some PD objects work without X11, some need X11... make sure paula has it
Apr 15 22:59:42 <aleij> it says something like #pages sent
Apr 15 22:59:54 <aleij> is just audio
Apr 15 23:00:04 <aleij> no x11
Apr 15 23:00:11 <aleij> we use oggcast
Apr 15 23:00:22 <aleij> oggcast~
Apr 15 23:00:36 <aether9> ahhh.. ;) you want us to stop using the flash player..
Apr 15 23:00:45 <aether9> smart
Apr 15 23:00:55 <aleij> it goes out as .mp3
Apr 15 23:00:59 <aleij> but yea
Apr 15 23:01:04 <paula> error: inlet: no method for 'symbol'
Apr 15 23:01:04 <paula> ... you might be able to track this down from the Find menu.

Apr 15 23:01:41 <aleij> that seems to be streaming
Apr 15 23:01:44 <aleij> but no sound
Apr 15 23:01:45 <aether9> that's a feature of IRC that sux somehow...
Apr 15 23:02:19 <aleij> paula, you see some level of sound in the mic leve meter?
Apr 15 23:02:28 <aleij> yes, big flood
Apr 15 23:02:31 <paula> yes
Apr 15 23:02:37 <aleij> anyway.. i think this wont work
Apr 15 23:02:40 <aleij> as manuel says
Apr 15 23:02:52 <aleij> the flash interface wont eat that
Apr 15 23:03:02 <aleij> will require a java plug-in
Apr 15 23:03:09 <paula> i think it could with more time ahead to find the way... maybe
Apr 15 23:03:25 <aleij> sure, it was just a fast test
Apr 15 23:03:39 <aleij> it works or it doesnt
Apr 15 23:03:41 <paula> ahhh, it must be that, usually corporations dont like rebels
Apr 15 23:03:45 <aether9> let's wait 6 months and use shoutcast/mp3 for now
Apr 15 23:04:01 <aleij> 6months?
Apr 15 23:04:54 <aether9> for the mozilla VLC ogg plugin to reach 95% browser-share
Apr 15 23:05:53 <aether9> or for java to change their logo
Apr 15 23:06:09 <aleij> i was using this beta for firefox
Apr 15 23:06:15 <aleij> it has all that included
Apr 15 23:06:29 <aleij> minefield is the name
Apr 15 23:06:38 <aether9> ok, will have a look
Apr 15 23:06:44 <aleij> but its said that opera integrates ogg already
Apr 15 23:06:47 <aether9> sounds good;)
Apr 15 23:06:50 <aleij> not tested
Apr 15 23:06:58 <aether9> ogg audio+ video?
Apr 15 23:07:03 <aleij> yes
Apr 15 23:07:08 <paula> cool
Apr 15 23:07:10 <aleij> minefield did
Apr 15 23:07:12 <paula> i must test that
Apr 15 23:07:21 <aleij> is quite clean
Apr 15 23:07:34 <aleij> just transparent for the user
Apr 15 23:07:51 <aleij> but yes, 6months at least to have some stable version
Apr 15 23:07:57 <aether9> do you have a good example page somewhere, or do i have to google around?
Apr 15 23:08:15 <aleij> yes they had one
Apr 15 23:08:18 <aleij> let me see
Apr 15 23:09:26 <aether9> the thing is.. we can decide to bypass explorer, but what about our parents who use safari?
Apr 15 23:09:32 <aether9> ;)
Apr 15 23:10:39 <paula> where is Chloe situated? she wil transmit from where?
Apr 15 23:10:43 <aether9> (or in the case of my parents, icab under OS9 ...)
Apr 15 23:10:59 <aether9> from brussels, as well as Laure
Apr 15 23:11:13 <aether9> and she will not do text, she will do camera and acting
Apr 15 23:11:28 <aether9> or camera and directing.. better ask her
Apr 15 23:12:12 <paula> audrey in rotterdam?
Apr 15 23:12:13 <aether9> or simply put that credit for both chloe and laure: camera, acting, directing
Apr 15 23:12:32 <aether9> yes, audrey in rotterdam, does the webcam coordination
Apr 15 23:13:09 <paula> 3. Audrey Samson (webcam orchestration)
Apr 15 23:13:10 <paula>        Rotterdam transmission

Apr 15 23:14:02 <paula> Chloè
Apr 15 23:16:49 <aether9> no, other way
Apr 15 23:18:19 <aether9> alejo, my firefox 2.0.0.13 says "Sorry, this browser does not support the video element."
Apr 15 23:18:49 <aether9> so it works in firefox 3 beta?
Apr 15 23:19:22 <aether9> (paula: accent in Chloe is upward)
Apr 15 23:19:43 <paula> Chloé
Apr 15 23:19:47 <aether9> yes!
Apr 15 23:35:18 <aleij> manuel,yes its a special beta version
Apr 15 23:35:30 <aleij> called minefield
Apr 15 23:35:40 <aleij> but i can seem to find the link
Apr 15 23:35:45 <aleij> let me try again
Apr 15 23:35:51 <aleij> i was elsewhere
Apr 15 23:40:13 <aleij> aether9:

Apr 15 23:40:17 <aleij> http://www.double.co.nz/video_test/
Apr 15 23:56:48 <aether9> thnks.. no build for macPPC unfortunately (i work on obsolete machines by principle..)
Apr 15 23:58:06 <aether9> paula, sent you some AIM accounts via email, so you can skip the whole registration procedure
Apr 15 23:58:13 <aleij> but there is a linux one
Apr 15 23:59:07 <paula> como asi una linux?
Apr 15 23:59:12 <paula> voy a mirar
Apr 15 23:59:33 <paula> que bueno, sin inscribirme uso una cuenta que me mandas para lo de maana?
Apr 15 23:59:58 <paula> te le vas a pegar al chat?
Apr 16 00:05:32 <aleij> maana a las 6pm creo que prefiero ir a tomarme unas polas

Apr 16 00:06:11 <aleij> pero a las 6 y con la primavera.. :S

Apr 16 13:56:07 <paljudy_> Done...am just re-doin screen grab to match script for text...Good Morning
Apr 16 13:56:20 <bk2> early for you!
Apr 16 13:56:25 <paljudy_> very
Apr 16 13:56:47 <bk2> woke up with so many mails in the mailbox, had to laugh...
Apr 16 13:56:56 <bk2> on aether the list i mean
Apr 16 13:57:11 <paljudy_> but...this is the only time of day NYC downtown is quiet...otherwise its night city
Apr 16 13:57:22 <bk2> nice
Apr 16 13:57:32 <bk2> dusk
Apr 16 13:58:20 <paljudy_> exactly....and I have fixed the same text so many times that I feel as if I am being punished in grade schol
Apr 16 13:58:25 <paljudy_> school
Apr 16 13:58:56 <bk2> ah , this text, yes.
Apr 16 13:59:37 <bk2> should be simple, appears not to be. i don't understand why she takes care of not in spanish or french.
Apr 16 13:59:43 <bk2> if
Apr 16 14:00:00 <bk2> anyway, it will be like this. manu is here updating the webpage.
Apr 16 14:00:05 <paljudy_> I have sent the PR release to Heather Wagner at Location1 where they are now offering a virtual residency...am not sure what that can do for us but I know them and will expect to be called in to talk about it
Apr 16 14:00:28 <bk2> paula is not here for rehearsal, we can talk about PR and mail announcment
Apr 16 14:00:34 <bk2> prepare it.
Apr 16 14:00:44 <bk2> wich PR release xyou sent?
Apr 16 14:00:49 <paljudy_> mine
Apr 16 14:01:19 <bk2> ok. would it be usefull to share it? or it's way personal?
Apr 16 14:01:27 <paljudy_> we need only to give avanced warning so that they will watch
Apr 16 14:02:08 <paljudy_> I had to do this two days ago and except for spelling and time correction it is exactly what I sent Manu then
Apr 16 14:03:36 <bk2> ok
Apr 16 14:03:56 <paljudy_> i agree...one must keep it simple....nobody likes to scroll even
Apr 16 14:04:53 <bk2> for me it's totally absurd that the names and function of everybody appears in a mail press/PR release
Apr 16 14:05:09 <bk2> link to website, that's it for me.
Apr 16 14:05:20 <bk2> we need it to look sexy (in my pov)
Apr 16 14:05:40 <bk2> not a long and borish typicall cultural/artistic event announcment
Apr 16 14:05:50 <paljudy_> otherwise i have let the deadline slide for the netaudio festival in the UK since there was no time for anyone to tell me if the idea with 
Apr 16 14:06:18 <paljudy_> Vexations was doable.....but it will be here as an idea for a later date
Apr 16 14:06:28 <bk2> oh yeah! i finbally got word2008 and read it. the concept from Cale or you or both is great 
Apr 16 14:06:50 <bk2> when is the deadline? dead allready?
Apr 16 14:07:22 <bk2> (sorry for not beeing more there about this - i just found a real job in a big art gallery in brusells, and was very into this recently)
Apr 16 14:07:46 <paljudy_> Yes...likewise the workshops need to be performances...interesting for everyone, not university style presentations
Apr 16 14:08:10 <paljudy_> I know....about $$...I am so broke 
Apr 16 14:08:19 <bk2> (all the names will roll as credits at end of performance)
Apr 16 14:08:34 <bk2> me too, quite broke
Apr 16 14:08:48 <bk2> by the eway, my friend Psyche found a place to stay in nyc
Apr 16 14:09:00 <paljudy_> ...but I am unemployable....imagine my CV
Apr 16 14:09:20 <bk2> and about your funny idea, she told me humorously that she did it already in cannes with no effects..
Apr 16 14:09:58 <paljudy_> ahhhh. now it is not just the action , but rather the PR that makes it work
Apr 16 14:10:28 <bk2> most likely
Apr 16 14:10:29 <paljudy_> Also....Aether....where's the t-shirt
Apr 16 14:10:49 <paljudy_> note that the mapping fest sells their own
Apr 16 14:11:21 <bk2> in the future we could contact well in advancee the hosts (like mapping) to discuss this matter.
Apr 16 14:11:33 <bk2> these kinf of matters.
Apr 16 14:12:50 <bk2> my cv makes me quite a problem to find job as well. but i hope i found something really interesting. and unexpected.
Apr 16 14:15:07 <bk2> i am going to work on more concise press release for everybody to send to their mailinglists now. 
Apr 16 14:15:23 <bk2> did you quiote Sir Oliver Lodge?
Apr 16 14:16:32 <bk2> nice quote anyway for us.
Apr 16 14:17:18 <bk2> for the PR, i will not use html-mail (bold, italic and stuff), some people get it mixed up.
Apr 16 14:20:44 <paljudy_> Is there a fee for either of these performances? The doll hse and getting a camera were a bit of expense?
Apr 16 14:21:30 <paljudy_> I didn't use the Sir Oliver Lodge quote....I kept if very simple indeed
Apr 16 14:25:10 <bk2> mapping or manizales don't pay aether. after the upcoming performances, we need to make calculations and payments, yes. shady matter still as we don't have any clear system. 
Apr 16 14:26:20 <paljudy_> We do need something to sell
Apr 16 14:26:48 <bk2> do we need it?
Apr 16 14:28:21 <paljudy_> the up-side is that the actually performances are improving, but I am serious about figuring out the issues on the back end of this project is 
Apr 16 14:28:53 <paljudy_> cricial to advancing the genre of this kind of discipline.....crucial
Apr 16 14:32:45 <bk2> i understand this fully and agree with you. i am concetrated to work on mail and update of site.
Apr 16 14:32:51 <paljudy_> I am still in touch with 'Creative Capital' grant. Its value is that it mentors on the $ practical side
Apr 16 14:32:51 <bk2> check the update by the way
Apr 16 14:32:58 <paljudy_> will do
Apr 16 14:33:00 <bk2> http://1904.cc/aether/
Apr 16 14:33:50 <bk2> pragmatic $ side. i want to think about it more. not right now :-) 
Apr 16 14:34:05 <bk2> think about it in group, indeed, it's good.
Apr 16 14:35:59 <paljudy_> looks good.....I like the way the'special guest' item is listed. we will be able to ask almost any composer to do this once we can pay them something or get a gallery to commission them
Apr 16 14:36:21 <paljudy_> is it linked.....search engines by guest's name/

Apr 17 20:12:32 <ideacritik> paljudy_: very good!!!!
Apr 17 20:12:35 <NUNICK_> for his blog
Apr 17 20:12:45 <ideacritik> NUNICK: tu vas nous donner le url?
Apr 17 20:12:51 <ideacritik> tout a lheure.
Apr 17 20:12:52 <NUNICK_> but if the connection is to slowly we must stop
Apr 17 20:12:56 <NUNICK_> anyway
Apr 17 20:13:11 <NUNICK_> take the link, it is very iteresting the proyect he is doing
Apr 17 20:13:13 <ideacritik> NUNICK: but for now we rehearse we use patch 394 and no funny test server business....
Apr 17 20:13:23 <NUNICK_> he worked with us in tremor festival.
Apr 17 20:13:24 <NUNICK_> to bring some clarity into this:
Apr 17 20:13:24 <NUNICK_> * EZ-7z_v.0.6_OSX = a little thingie that helps to decompress the 
Apr 17 20:13:24 <NUNICK_> "servers.7z" file (which is encrypted to protect our most sensitive 
Apr 17 20:13:25 <NUNICK_> information: the server access codes).
Apr 17 20:13:25 <paljudy_> now ...its just giss for sound that I need url on VLC...for stream selection
Apr 17 20:13:25 <NUNICK_> * Pd-0.39.3-extended = Pure Data : the open-source alternative to 
Apr 17 20:13:25 <NUNICK_> MaxMSP (running on Linux, OSX and Windows), which would be great for 
Apr 17 20:13:27 <NUNICK_> us to use, but it's not very easy for beginners. Luka, who knows the 
Apr 17 20:13:29 <NUNICK_> program well, wrote a version of the upload patch (however anybody 
Apr 17 20:13:31 <NUNICK_> who uses it will need to dig a bit inside the code to update the 
Apr 17 20:13:33 <NUNICK_> server list).

Apr 17 21:39:19 * fe2cruz has quit ("http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client")
Apr 17 21:39:38 <chloe_> or you stop uploading and I do it
Apr 17 21:39:39 <ideacritik> so we only do the shot with town and our faces for the real perfo later?
Apr 17 21:39:54 <chloe_> what do you mean?
Apr 17 21:40:11 <chloe_> nice webcam on frame 7
Apr 17 21:40:34 <chloe_> I'd like to try another color correction on dollhouse
Apr 17 21:40:35 <ideacritik> frame 7 is being done by someone else... not me....
Apr 17 21:40:56 <chloe_> the images are not as pretty as the dollhouse could be
Apr 17 21:41:02 <ideacritik> i mean that part where we show 'rotterdam' (ville) printend on wall with us next to it...
Apr 17 21:41:06 <aether9> sorry audrey, its me
Apr 17 21:41:06 <chloe_> a little bit to flat and clinic
Apr 17 21:41:14 <aether9> sending images from Tomsk
Apr 17 21:41:23 <ideacritik> chloe_: which images are you talking about now
Apr 17 21:41:28 <chloe_> dollhouse
Apr 17 21:41:39 <ideacritik> ah ok -- not webcams
Apr 17 21:41:43 <chloe_> how do you do to put the red color on your IRC text?
Apr 17 21:41:51 <chloe_> cool...
Apr 17 21:42:10 <ideacritik> but di di get this wrong -= i printed 'ROTTERDAM' AND put it on my wall - thinking i would have to stand next to it a tthe end of the perfo...
Apr 17 21:42:11 <chloe_> Wolf was really missing too
Apr 17 21:42:35 <chloe_> we dropped this idea
Apr 17 21:42:58 <chloe_> I interpreted Manuel's wish with the beginning tool
Apr 17 21:43:11 <chloe_> I mean effect
Apr 17 21:43:27 <chloe_> I thought this was what he meant 
Apr 17 21:43:39 <ideacritik> ah!!!!!!!!!!!
Apr 17 21:43:50 <chloe_> As this is the end, Judy, could you upload images of you dollhouse again?

Apr 17 21:44:17 <ideacritik> hahaahahah - i got that all wrong - i though he wanted to show the 'liveness' so that we should appear at eh end of the 'show' like in novi sad - in front of cam
Apr 17 21:44:35 <chloe_> I actually don't know...
Apr 17 21:44:40 <chloe_> this web communication
Apr 17 21:44:46 <chloe_> interpretation
Apr 17 21:44:54 <chloe_> is very big part
Apr 17 21:44:59 <chloe_> of the process
Apr 17 21:45:30 <chloe_> Judy, are you here?
Apr 17 21:45:36 <ideacritik> well it could be nice to do so - i saw they have geneva on wall printed
Apr 17 21:45:39 <fe2cruz> fell off again, how is paula's workshop going do we break now?
Apr 17 21:45:52 <ideacritik> paula is not answering in #aether9workshop
Apr 17 21:45:59 <ideacritik> so i assume she is busy talking
Apr 17 21:46:28 <ideacritik> okido - well i will sit it out till the workshop calls on us...
Apr 17 21:46:35 <ideacritik> and check if they set up streaming
Apr 17 21:46:42 <chloe_> I liked the first part of the performance
Apr 17 21:46:48 <fe2cruz> i missed some bits of the chat, are we done?
Apr 17 21:46:48 <paljudy_> no...I am not doing the workshop....I will re-do my color squares and be back at 
Apr 17 21:47:11 <chloe_> but when it comes to the critical moment, we didn't manage to create the beauty that was there for a couple of rehearsa
Apr 17 21:47:34 <chloe_> Judy?
Apr 17 21:47:56 <paljudy_> before 7 PM NY time for transmission....would be nice to have sound for me....but it seems the least of our issues
Apr 17 21:48:27 <paljudy_> yes I am listening...reading Chloe
Apr 17 21:48:31 <chloe_> what did YOU thin of the colors?
Apr 17 21:48:57 <chloe_> don't you want to try it now?
Apr 17 21:49:06 <paljudy_> oddly not rich....I am subject to natural light here
Apr 17 21:49:41 <paljudy_> try...what?
Apr 17 21:49:57 <chloe_> I am sure we can do something more glamorous
Apr 17 21:50:22 <chloe_> well, you film and color correct and we see what it looks like
Apr 17 21:50:45 <paljudy_> yes....I will try....by 7 I will also have rich golden light, I face south
Apr 17 21:50:59 <chloe_> great! like on the stills
Apr 17 21:51:05 <chloe_> the light is very nice on them
Apr 17 21:51:17 <paljudy_> will try now then.....still from late afternoon
Apr 17 21:51:52 <chloe_> I have one on my computer desktop background...
Apr 17 21:52:38 <chloe_> nice, allready with more contrast it loks better
Apr 17 21:52:45 <paljudy_> better
Apr 17 21:53:21 <chloe_> and on the close ups
Apr 17 21:53:32 <paljudy_> I like that gold paint to be picked up in Late afternoon light
Apr 17 21:54:04 <chloe_> ah yes, I liked how you were introducing the caracters at the begining
Apr 17 21:54:24 <chloe_> It could be nice to have the wolf as well
Apr 17 21:54:46 <fe2cruz> manuel, streaming to aether.mp3 seems to be down again. stream won't stay connected
Apr 17 21:55:01 <chloe_> also because #3 could sometimes watch what you are showing with interest
Apr 17 21:55:02 <chloe_> nice images
Apr 17 21:55:10 <paljudy_> I have the shittest 10 dollar tripod too
Apr 17 21:55:24 <chloe_> I understand
Apr 17 21:55:29 <paljudy_> I have to keep hand on it or it drifts
Apr 17 21:55:50 <chloe_> and you are allone I guess
Apr 17 21:55:55 <paljudy_> yes
Apr 17 21:56:17 <chloe_> it's gonna be fine
Apr 17 21:56:31 <chloe_> take your time to upload each thing you want to show
Apr 17 21:56:43 <chloe_> this way it will be seen
Apr 17 21:56:51 <chloe_> the images are powerfull
Apr 17 21:56:52 <paljudy_> oh...I know...I am more concerned about paula with so much to manage
Apr 17 21:57:20 <chloe_> Yes, but we can't help her
Apr 17 21:57:22 <paljudy_> Thanks....they connect the other squares to the story....my intent
Apr 17 21:57:34 <chloe_> exactly
Apr 17 21:57:38 <paljudy_> I heard no sound
Apr 17 21:57:49 <chloe_> nobody did
Apr 17 21:57:54 <paljudy_> ah
Apr 17 21:58:00 <chloe_> I don't know what was the problem
Apr 17 21:59:05 <paljudy_> I will try no to re-do the text square and blk square
Apr 17 21:59:26 <ideacritik> btw - for workshop we are on #aether9workshop

Apr 17 22:05:50 <chloe_> I really want to think of a way to improvise with rules
Apr 17 22:06:12 <chloe_> ?t could be something like: 
Apr 17 22:06:25 <chloe_> one frame for the main character
Apr 17 22:06:44 <chloe_> (or one performer, sometimes using several frames, uploading similar images)
Apr 17 22:06:54 <chloe_> I like the repetition of images...
Apr 17 22:07:01 <chloe_> One performer for the setting,
Apr 17 22:07:11 <chloe_> one for the danger/ennemy
Apr 17 22:07:18 <chloe_> one for the unconscious
Apr 17 22:07:21 <chloe_> etc.
Apr 17 22:07:23 * paljudy_ has quit ("Leaving")
Apr 17 22:07:34 <chloe_> but one thing each., and no pre-written script
Apr 17 22:08:02 <chloe_> because there are so beautiful things during impro
Apr 17 22:09:01 <chloe_> Am i alone here?
Apr 17 22:09:01 <chloe_> ok see you at 00:20 CET
Apr 17 22:09:01 <ideacritik> im reading... 
Apr 17 22:09:08 <ideacritik> but im following other window in case workhsop begins
Apr 17 22:09:19 <ideacritik> k c u later chloe_ 
Apr 17 22:10:29 <bk2> so we meet at 00:00 cet? manu and me are going to eat something and be back before 00:00 anyway.
Apr 17 22:11:05 <aether9> well, what i meant was indeed printing the location name and putting it on the wall
Apr 17 22:11:26 <aether9> sorry, answering an old topic
Apr 17 22:14:18 <ideacritik> aether9: i did that actually... so i could be ready to do it.
Apr 17 22:16:36 <aether9> i prefer it too, rather than just text on black..
Apr 17 22:16:55 <aether9> and please, let's all use arial font in this case... ;)
Apr 17 22:18:01 <ideacritik> i used helvetica - close enough i think .... you are now talking about the initial shot? or the print on the wall at teh end?
Apr 17 22:26:00 <ideacritik> who is uploading  in frame 8?
Apr 17 22:26:02 <ideacritik> currently

Apr 17 22:47:20 <aleij> (again)
Apr 17 22:50:30 <fe2cruz> lucy was on there now they are coming back i think
Apr 17 22:51:12 <aether9> we're in the #aether9workshop chanel now
Apr 17 22:51:59 <ideacritik> im on IRC only....
Apr 17 22:52:12 <bk2> i uploaded frame herre
Apr 17 22:52:27 <aether9> it is irc, just (slash)join #aether9workshop
Apr 17 22:52:34 <ideacritik> aether9:  im wondering if i have to do this servers.txt from server_example... etc thing
Apr 17 22:52:47 <ideacritik> aether9: jy suis depuis tantot
Apr 17 22:53:46 <aether9> idea, as you want, if you want to upload to the workshop-frameset, you have to use the servers-example list
Apr 17 22:54:02 <aether9> but be sure to keep to original servers for the performance afterwards..
Apr 17 22:54:06 <ideacritik> aether9: what do you mean upload the workshop-frameset?
Apr 17 22:54:18 <ideacritik> this is the missing part of the explanation for me
Apr 17 22:54:26 * fe2cruz has quit ("http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client")
Apr 17 22:54:30 <ideacritik> 'cause i did the server_example name change earlier
Apr 17 22:54:37 <aether9> inside the main patch folder, is a folder named "sample_HTML"
Apr 17 22:54:55 <ideacritik> ah!!!! 
Apr 17 22:55:00 <ideacritik> bonjour audrey!
Apr 17 22:55:02 <ideacritik> ....
Apr 17 22:55:02 <aether9> inside is a frameset.html file, that shows the images uploaded to the "example_servers"
Apr 17 22:55:19 <aether9> which are for public use, such as workshops...

Apr 17 22:56:37 <ideacritik> ah me voila - mon upload frame 7 d'il ya 5 heures... 
Apr 17 22:56:53 <ideacritik> reveil en delai a rotterdam heure de colombie.... :S
Apr 17 22:58:06 <ideacritik> mais.. attend aether9 what is the online url of the test-frame for workshop? the one i see is local...
Apr 17 23:00:17 <fe2cruz> there should be a little bell in all laptop enter keys
Apr 17 23:11:20 <fe2cruz> the text from the screen looks ugly. the credits need to be rethought
Apr 17 23:11:47 <fe2cruz> maybe increase the sharpness settings of the webcam?
Apr 17 23:15:50 <ideacritik> fe2cruz: sharpness settings? i have only brightness contrast and b&w....
Apr 17 23:16:05 <bk2> i just made a little test with credits. you refer to this?
Apr 17 23:16:22 <bk2> i'll do it now again in frame4
Apr 17 23:17:26 <bk2> quite ugly indeed.
Apr 17 23:17:34 <fe2cruz> too hard too read
Apr 17 23:17:44 <fe2cruz> not sharp enough
Apr 17 23:17:45 <bk2> yes
Apr 17 23:18:10 <bk2> like that?
Apr 17 23:18:22 <fe2cruz> farsi?
Apr 17 23:18:23 <bk2> let's see...
Apr 17 23:18:50 <bk2> maybe upload for some time the credits in different windows simply
Apr 17 23:19:08 <bk2> (by the way thanks for the sample, will see with the band if they want to use iut)
Apr 17 23:19:31 <fe2cruz> no problem
Apr 17 23:19:51 <fe2cruz> what are you trying to do have the credits scroll
Apr 17 23:19:53 <fe2cruz> ?
Apr 17 23:20:11 <bk2> no, just display them.
Apr 17 23:34:31 <bk2> doing another credit test in frame4
Apr 17 23:35:06 <fe2cruz> not sure why but pink is clearest
Apr 17 23:35:25 <fe2cruz> upir boris blue is nice
Apr 17 23:35:42 <bk2> light blue and pink?

Apr 17 23:38:21 <bk2> light blue and yellow c'est bon.
Apr 17 23:38:38 <bk2> un peude variations. ?a fait un peu gar?on
Apr 17 23:38:47 <bk2> les gar?ons et les filles...
Apr 17 23:38:49 <bk2> mais bon
Apr 17 23:39:13 <ideacritik> blanc c'est pas bon?

Apr 17 23:39:43 <bk2> puorquoi pas je r??ssaie
Apr 17 23:41:20 <bk2> it's more sober b&w
Apr 17 23:41:38 <ideacritik> bk2: je ne sais pas quesceque tu utilise pour la couleur - mais si tu pouvais faire un #eeeeee pour le blanc
Apr 17 23:41:39 <bk2> it's too fast though
Apr 17 23:41:57 <ideacritik> ca serait parfait - just un peu moins 'ouch' pour les yeux - 
Apr 17 23:42:09 <chloe_> alors il faut pr?parer un paneau en Arial accroch? sur un mur, c'est ?a?
Apr 17 23:42:22 <chloe_> est-ce que l'info est vraiment pass?e ? tout le monde?
Apr 17 23:42:23 <ideacritik> chloe_: c'est ce que manu disait
Apr 17 23:42:29 <chloe_> c'est beau ce que vous faites
Apr 17 23:42:46 <ideacritik> ca je ne sais pas... moi je l'ai - geneve aussi - mais les autres... ?
Apr 17 23:43:05 <chloe_> ben non, Judy, Chris, Paula...
Apr 17 23:43:14 <chloe_> ce ne sera pas tr?s uniforme
Apr 17 23:43:21 <ideacritik> en effet oui
Apr 17 23:43:25 <chloe_> ? moins de les pr?parer pour eux et de les uploader ? leur place
Apr 17 23:44:17 <ideacritik> cest impossible puisque l'idee est de mettre le truc sur le mur et de filmer le 'performer' live devant sa 'pancarte' si j'ai bien compris

Apr 17 23:44:53 <ideacritik> fe2cruz: have you prepared a sheet of paper with your town on it - printed on wall?
Apr 17 23:45:30 <fe2cruz> i have one yes
Apr 17 23:45:57 <ideacritik> do you knwo if judy does?
Apr 17 23:46:38 <fe2cruz> irc keeps hiccuping
Apr 17 23:46:38 <fe2cruz> i have a little card to display under me
Apr 17 23:46:58 <ideacritik> i see you hiccuping yes
Apr 17 23:47:49 <fe2cruz> maybe
Apr 17 23:48:36 <chloe_> Should it be centered or alignment on the left
Apr 17 23:48:40 <bk2> so i got readable credits that i can upload one after the other in one frame OR
Apr 17 23:49:05 <bk2> in different frames (for 2 minutes or so, then black or whatever)
Apr 17 23:49:22 <bk2> (it is different from the basic idea, i think we need both.
Apr 17 23:49:39 <bk2> basic idea: performer with printed location on the wall
Apr 17 23:49:47 <bk2> question: at begining or end?
Apr 17 23:50:10 <bk2> (i suggest end for coordination reasons, but manu prefers begining for clarifiaction to audience...)
Apr 17 23:50:21 <fe2cruz> why not upload just the black readable credits to 5 out of the 9 frames
Apr 17 23:50:23 <bk2> what do YOU think after all lol?
Apr 17 23:50:27 <fe2cruz> 10 frames
Apr 17 23:50:32 <bk2> i like it chris!
Apr 17 23:50:42 <bk2> black readable credits to 5 out of the 9 frames
Apr 17 23:51:05 <bk2> black readable credits to 5 out of the 9 frames
Apr 17 23:51:05 <bk2> one time
Apr 17 23:51:06 <chloe_> centr? ou align?s
Apr 17 23:51:07 <bk2> two times
Apr 17 23:51:09 <chloe_> ?
Apr 17 23:51:14 <bk2> aligned
Apr 17 23:51:17 <bk2> tree times
Apr 17 23:51:23 <bk2> sold!
Apr 17 23:51:36 <fe2cruz> test it use the fader option
Apr 17 23:52:14 <chloe_> BK, j'ai donn? word office ? Laure, ok?
Apr 17 23:52:39 <chloe_> black readable credits to 5 out of the 9 frames
Apr 17 23:52:44 <chloe_> what does it mean?
Apr 17 23:53:19 <fe2cruz> i think boris will show us in a bit

Apr 17 23:55:54 <bk2> (a problem is the chat thing. almost impossible to do it fast and live)
Apr 17 23:55:55 <aleij> fe2cruz: maybe use ircatwork.com or.. are you on a wifi connection?
Apr 17 23:57:37 <ideacritik> re-bonjour - workhosp termine.
Apr 17 23:57:42 <fe2cruz> its mibbit.com now and i'm on hard wire cable
Apr 17 23:57:43 <bk2> ok
Apr 17 23:58:30 <bk2> so chris you have regular problems? should we use skype instead?
Apr 17 23:58:50 <fe2cruz> no its not a big deal
Apr 17 23:58:53 <bk2> ok
Apr 17 23:59:26 <bk2> WOLF: how sweetly the little birds are singing
Apr 17 23:59:26 <bk2> WOLF: how sweetly the little birds are singing
Apr 17 23:59:34 <bk2> (just a copy paste test...
Apr 18 00:00:01 <bk2> WOLF: come to dinner with me?
Apr 18 00:00:01 <bk2> WOLF: do you want to see my ears?
Apr 18 00:00:01 <bk2> acts weird the copy paste
Apr 18 00:00:40 <bk2> ok - found the way to do the chat must faster on livejamin.
Apr 18 00:00:53 <bk2> will do a live training now on frame whatever
Apr 18 00:01:35 <fe2cruz> i'll take a 20 minute breather too
Apr 18 00:01:52 <chloe_> question: shoud Laure and me stand side by side for the begin credit or is it better that we keep the illusion of her being just a livejasmin girl?
Apr 18 00:02:33 <ideacritik> shouldnt we keep the beginnign as it was and do the live version with text on wall at the end?
Apr 18 00:02:43 <ideacritik> solving the 'illusion' problem... 
Apr 18 00:02:55 <ideacritik> like 'revealing' at teh end ... 
Apr 18 00:03:32 <aether9> we need to have clarity regarding the BEGINNING CREDITS/LOCATION NAMES
Apr 18 00:03:54 <aether9> so what option do we want:
Apr 18 00:04:07 <aether9> 1) just location name on black
Apr 18 00:04:36 <aether9> 2) view of aether operator, with location name printed/ written on the wall
Apr 18 00:05:24 <ideacritik> i think both. 1) in beginning and 2) at end
Apr 18 00:06:40 <aether9> that's a possibility indeed
Apr 18 00:07:34 <aether9> however i quite liked to idea to have those views of our working spaces, in those endless "last 5 minutes" while waiting for the beginning of the performance
Apr 18 00:07:52 <aether9> more entertaining, i think
Apr 18 00:08:10 <ideacritik> you have a point... 
Apr 18 00:08:19 <ideacritik> im open to all options - 
Apr 18 00:08:24 <aether9> but we would need to see it to know if it really works..
Apr 18 00:08:38 <ideacritik> yes - we could try now if others are there... others?
Apr 18 00:09:22 <aether9> other point, if we do just text in the begginning, we should at least use the same font + font size
Apr 18 00:10:40 <ideacritik> why? isnt variety a bit more symbolic of different people and geographic locations?
Apr 18 00:10:53 <ideacritik> (and less impossible to organise 1h before perfo?)
Apr 18 00:11:05 <ideacritik> jsut trying to be practical al.so./...
Apr 18 00:11:19 <bk2> yes, manu forget this synchronisation
Apr 18 00:11:37 <ideacritik> we can think of this for mapping though
Apr 18 00:11:43 <ideacritik> what / how we want it
Apr 18 00:14:50 <bk2> i liked the variations at the beggining - let's keep it that way, we'll lose so much time otherwise.
Apr 18 00:15:20 <bk2> so each person uploads his location the way he wants...
Apr 18 00:15:33 <bk2> at the end though i'll throw the uniformed cridits
Apr 18 00:16:39 <bk2> chloe?
Apr 18 00:16:58 <bk2> saylor?

Apr 18 00:17:55 <ideacritik> can i test my 'location shot' to see if its ok or not?
Apr 18 00:18:10 <ideacritik> frame 7 lets say
Apr 18 00:18:23 <paljudy_> sure I will look
Apr 18 00:18:28 <ideacritik> that is to say if we still do this live with text on wall... or did we drop this?
Apr 18 00:18:33 <ideacritik> ok frame 7
Apr 18 00:19:34 <paljudy_> Not sure....BK though credits were sloppy but the story text was not discussed
Apr 18 00:19:40 <paljudy_> thought
Apr 18 00:20:52 <bk2> hmm?

Apr 18 00:23:11 <paljudy_> and?
Apr 18 00:23:25 <ideacritik> paljudy_: hard to say how it went - communicataion mostly in spanish and not much uploading - 
Apr 18 00:23:38 <ideacritik> not much communication between the remote and the local in other words
Apr 18 00:23:39 <bk2> you can see the state of the interface we used here?:
Apr 18 00:23:39 <bk2> file:///Users/boris/Desktop/n3k08/aether9/ActuelAether/upload_394/sample_HTML/frameset.html
Apr 18 00:23:41 <aether9> paljudy - are you sending that image? (frame2)
Apr 18 00:23:47 <bk2> (it0s the test interface)
Apr 18 00:23:48 <paljudy_> yes
Apr 18 00:23:53 <ideacritik> we will have to wait for paula's comments
Apr 18 00:24:13 <bk2> mmm sorry...
Apr 18 00:24:42 <bk2> ah judy to see the results of the test page, go into your patch folder
Apr 18 00:25:09 <bk2> go into the "sample_HTML" folder
Apr 18 00:25:17 <bk2> and open "frameset"
Apr 18 00:25:32 <bk2> you will see uploaded workshopers there
Apr 18 00:26:40 <ideacritik> well hardly anything though... a few isolated frame - single uploads hre and ther....
Apr 18 00:27:31 <paljudy_> I see.....not much to guess how it went/is...but nice to see Colombia in the sun

Apr 18 00:33:36 <ideacritik> we were thinking if we could do this version of the intro - as i have in frame7 -- but only if its possible - i mean its short notice and all..
Apr 18 00:34:12 <paljudy_> No not printed.....I just re-did the vid grab since rehearsal though
Apr 18 00:34:23 <paljudy_> like this
Apr 18 00:35:12 <ideacritik> so shall we keep it all like that or have a mix of judy's version and mine for example? thoughts anyoen?
