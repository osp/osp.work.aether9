Hi all,
I throw a script idea here. Still needs lots of input fortunately. I 
believe now that it would be better to do twice the same script for the 
2 april performances.

---

It is a first draft sort of inspired by the LRRH tale, an essay from Lev 
Manovich, sites like livejasmin.com and elements of our previous 
discussions. I also had a meeting with Chloé in a brussels bar yesterday 
night where we discussed this.
This requires 5 live performers. I guess that it would last about 40 
minutes.


LAYERS
 > remember the first script, i think we all liked the 3 layers: Gods / 
Stratosphere / underworld. I think we mostly liked it and in this 
proposal, there are also layers. But not so rigid: at times the fixed 
clear structure is broken when the performers decide to upload their 
images to another frame. There would be set moments for this principle, 
it would be chaotic (like an unpredictable frame battle - easy to do for 
the max-patch users, i don't know for performers who use another upload 
system)
(check Lev Manovich essay "Interaction as an Aesthetic Event" (2007), 
found the other day on manovich.net, a short must read that i attach it 
to this mail. Key quote: "Command-line interfaces "deliver the goods", 
that is, they focus on pure functionality and utility. GUI (Graphic User 
Interface) adds "service" to interfaces (like mac OS9). And at next 
stage, interfaces become "experiences" (like mac OSX) " (it helped me to 
imagine the 3 layers as: "goods / services / experiences" but i don't 
think we should remember this for a performance script really).
 

TOP LAYER (frames 1,2,3) - experiences
the Little Red Riding Hood
 > must attract all 5 senses.  
 > Shows 1 girl doing the webcam thing (check www.livejasmin.com to get 
the idea...) - her body is spread out on 3 frames, in the illogical 
horizontally way (assuming the girl is sitting and not laying on a 
matress for example, but she could switch positions of course):
frame 1: head and shoulders
frame 2: chest to tights
frame 3: legs
(This requires 3 cameras and 3 computers!)
 > Differently colored frames (Godard's "Contempt" / "Le mépris" style lol)
 > The girl is "typographed": lighten by a video-beamer (projector) if 
available: light, images and texts (screen surface would be the skin, 
the clothes and the wall in the background). Magical transparency etc.
 > The girl would wear red cape at times.
 > Live stream would be the sound environnement (spoken interactions 
between girls, with the technical assistant(s) and sounds from their 
surroundings).
 > A different girl could appear at times (i mean that they could 
switch, on location of the shooting: people on livesjasmin.com often 
operate from studios where different people work)
 > nb: I talked with Chloé who is enthusiastic for doing this part! And 
in bruxelles it would be totally feasible without big organisation fuzz 
to have 3 cameras and 3 computers for the 3 part upload. So we can 
assume that brussels could do this sort of complicate part :-)


MIDDLE LAYER (frames 4,5,6) - services
 > The Hunter, The Wolf, and other persons/things (grandmother? Dolls? 
Objects? central frame 5 could be a webcam highway all the time?) / 
could be the people through wich the tale is carried and transmitted / 
could be the people looking at the kind of peepshow / the forest / the house
 > The Wolf: a person could be disguised in wolf, wild and chaotic. 
Undecipherable. Basic instincts.
 > The Hunter: could be disguised with mustache, hat with feather, 
riffle. Could spend a lot of time cleaning his gun.


LOWER LAYER (frames 7,8,9) - goods
The transmission operator (frame 8) + 2 text frames (frames 7 + 9)
 > The Operator frame is played at the Mapping festival. He is in front 
of an old-fashionned greyish computer screen.He is the person managing 
the live Skype chat (that should be projected at Mapping). He has a desk 
with a lot of stuff around, like a police inspector (i am thinking of 
the police office at the end of "The Usual Suspects: crowded with 
pictures, notes, etc - here all these documents would relate to the LRRH 
case of course).
 >  black and white image only.
 > The Operator becomes mad when the frames change of place, when it is 
chaotic. Hence he would appear as a puppet-master whose puppets aren't 
obedient. Also as the manager of the webcam girl. I imagine he would 
have a eastern-mafia feel.
 > He gives orders at time to the girl of top layer (with text).

NARRATIVE
So far i've described mostly stuctural elements. But i feel we need 
actions. Like sketches. Series of little interactions (like in the last 
performance when there's the "murder with the typingmachine" betwwen 2 
frames). What will be doing :-) ?
This needs a lot of development. Here are a couple ideas:

 > When the Wolf catches the LRRH (by going up a ladder and exiting his 
frame by the top? bof...) , a curtain could come down on the LRRH (like 
when they do a private show in web-peepshows - well of course the morale 
of the the LRRH story can be read as: the LRRH shall have a lover (the 
wolf) before marriage (with the hunter)...

 > END: for the grand finale, i imagine with pleasure a big showdown 
(after a tense preparation time, like in westerns), with everybody 
shooting against everybody, and constantly changing of frames, so it 
would be a shooting chaotic ballet (before everybody going back to it's 
orîginal frame for the salutes - where the assistants also come in the 
image to salute).

 > There should be a moment of eating alltogether.

 > Text: in 1 text frame, the text could be a chat session between the 
LRRH, the hunter and the Wolf. They could be rambling over their great 
memories of they recall from their story, and the operator could be 
there as well (live on the skype-chat and somebody remote would take 
care to upload the logs into the text frame or we could write this chat 
session in advance and somebody would upload it as well.)
 (n3krozoft did a performance with images of a chatter and the chat: 
http://www.n3krozoft.com/projects/art/lol/index.html#
In the other text frame, something totally different could be going on.

 > I guess that to emphasize the actual LRRH tale, we could upload 
images from books / illustrations / drawings / dolls / films / comics 
etc. on the theme - or not on the theme actually :-)

 > SOUND:  i imagine BliscappenVonMaria could do "musique descriptive", 
i mean develop expressionistic themes around the themes of the LRRH.

////////

I believe this structure is an invitation to a lot of playfullness and 
inventions.
For instance the roles between the LRRH and the Wolf(es) can be inverted 
at some point. The LRRH could turn into a big eater, in a very 
disgusting way (dirty or jung food only, and alcohol) - well just a 
random thought.

Please don't hesitate to tell clearly your critics. If negative, please 
propose other concrete directions. Or if you wish to bring it to an all 
other level or direction, let's share ideas!

This is exciting.....I must still call around for a camera; I still have nothing but my Mac built-in...but I have built a doll house (thinking about Duchamp's valise) in which, with surreal sized objets relating to the Red Riding Hood story, I can build the emotive current of the story with signifiers. I am attaching jpgs. The dollhouse has six rooms and I can access the objets (barely) sticking my hands (with long stick on red fingernails) through the windows on the front. I hope you all like this; I think the smaller (rooms) boxes within on of the larger Aether boxes will give an odd scale/depth sensation that will relate to the body spread across three frames. The tits in the picture are tension toys for executives (weird to touch/squeeze).

The test of the new Aether page looks good.  I think doing the same performance twice is a good move. i will look at the references below. and also check about the web cams ....And if we think this dollhouse idea will work to show the elements of the myth in an emotional/ mental landscape , I will continue to collect ephemeria related to the story. I have watched an artist Laurie Simmons use cutouts from magazines propped up like paperdolls & moved in these scenerios....it is very dream-like.

And yes, I am glad to have anything to help my half hour lecture on Aether. 
The doll house is out in my own dollhouse sized apartment where I can see it and think...so feed back would be good. Also, are we sticking to having a single source for sound or not?   Great script start..... Judy
