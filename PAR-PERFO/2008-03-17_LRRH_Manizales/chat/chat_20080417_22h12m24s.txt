Apr 17 22:37:11 <ideacritik> the stream is disconnected i think?
Apr 17 22:37:16 <ideacritik> or back on again now... ok
Apr 17 22:39:38 <NUNICK> aqui estÃ¡ el pathc para los que ya tienen el jitler  y el runtime instalado
Apr 17 22:39:39 <NUNICK> http://1904.cc/~aether/kode/max_image_upload/upload_395.zip
Apr 17 22:40:35 <Lariana> Gracias NUNICK
Apr 17 22:41:51 * NUNICK is now known as paulavelez
Apr 17 22:48:53 <paulavelez> mmanu
Apr 17 22:49:07 <paulavelez> manu, now they have the patch
Apr 17 22:49:14 <aether9> yes, ok¨
Apr 17 22:49:36 <paulavelez> and we need to change the server text file to remplace it
Apr 17 22:49:45 <aether9> yes, very simple:
Apr 17 22:50:00 <aether9> use the file servers-example.txt
Apr 17 22:50:05 <aether9> and name it servers.txt
Apr 17 22:50:25 <aether9> then, the patch will read it

Apr 17 22:56:56 <paulavelez> manu, the main frame for this workshop transmission is?
Apr 17 22:57:06 <paulavelez> i dont know where did i put it
Apr 17 22:57:25 <aether9> it's inside the patch folder
Apr 17 22:57:29 <aether9> "sample_HTML"
Apr 17 22:57:57 <paulavelez> tnks
Apr 17 22:58:26 <ideacritik> aether9: but that is local non?
Apr 17 22:58:43 <aether9> yes
Apr 17 22:58:51 <aether9> but the images are one the servers..
Apr 17 22:59:24 <ideacritik> so aether9 then we dont 'upload' since we wont appear on their local computers obviously 
Apr 17 22:59:58 <aether9> we will... the "local" frameset reads the images from the ONLINE servers
Apr 17 23:00:09 <ideacritik> really?
Apr 17 23:00:27 <ideacritik> so in frame 7 people see my plants?
Apr 17 23:00:27 <aether9> i agree it's conceptually difficult to admint
Apr 17 23:00:29 <aether9> admit
Apr 17 23:00:46 <aether9> if you insist, you can also watch it from an online location:
Apr 17 23:00:48 <aether9> http://okarem.smtp.ru/
Apr 17 23:01:04 <aether9> but you will get 24 popup-windows (hopefully your firefox blocks them)
Apr 17 23:01:18 <aether9> (it's the russian business networks' servers...)
Apr 17 23:02:12 <aether9> and the whole point of having the html in a local folder, is that it's easyer for the workshop participants to have a look at the code
Apr 17 23:02:20 <ideacritik> i just did  aview source on frame7.html and i now get the russian business :)
