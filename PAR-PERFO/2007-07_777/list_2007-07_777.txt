i will be making tree-color pasta (fusilli tricolori) with tomato
sauce, with some vegetables added to the tomato sauce

in fact i am eating the pasta right now already and didn't start
making the sauce yet, but i will try to do that still later tonight to
have all the material ready for tomorrow

i need to first download the movies of the first part and charge the
batteries before i can continue the second part of cooking. it takes
quite some planning to cook a meal online

are there any other recipes? does anyone else already know what s/he will cook?

by the way, the three colored pasta i used is green, orange and white.
i might stick to those colors also with the vegetables and add the red
tomatoes as a contrast...

any suggestions how to add numbers and formulas to the recipe?

happy cooking,

cym

Hello,
so we will be 7!

following the set-up shaped as number 7,

XXX
-XX
XX-

i propose:

NORWAY      LA1              LA2
--------              BRUSSEL    GENEVA
SLOVENIA    AUSTRIA    --------

or in other words:

league front
n3krozoft front
slovenia front

in this disposition for instance:

Dr. Gomez   Dr. Shleidan   Dr. Madmann

-------------     BXL n3kro     GVA n3kro

Luka             Cym                ------------

///////////////

if the 3 league members can coordinate something, great!

here in brussels we are of course goig to respect the first and last 7 
minutes segments (presentation & eating) but haven't decided yet if we 
are going to explicitly respect the 5 middle 7 minute segments. surprise 
it will be.

i will carefully record the performance with a camera filming a computer 
screen.

see you all later,
Boris
