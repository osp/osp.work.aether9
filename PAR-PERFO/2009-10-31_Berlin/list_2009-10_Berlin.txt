Dear Aethernautes,

It is the end of summer, i (Chloé) met with Boris and we talked about the
Berlin meeting were we'll both be present. The discussion started about our
expectations and small "fears".
I hope that we will establish a kind of calendar for 2009-10, and define
performances to be developped.
I had bad experiences with unprepared collective activities gathering strong
personalities: endless discussions with no concrete conclusion or benefit
for the ongoing project.
Boris hopes to that we define new performances and that we establish a
clear(er) approach to what we do and how we do it (regarding the purely
artistic approach and also the editions, the buzz, the context in which we
want to operate).

So we thought: "let's make a proposal of points to be reflected on in order
to be ready for Berlin":
Christian already began in his last mail:
"How's the development of the residency project going?"
"Its Satyricon we are doing correct?"

We focused on the WHAT to do and HOW to do it ?
Here are the questions/ideas that we reflected on :

-  WHAT to do in Berlin ?
Determine clear subjects to be discussed during the Berlin-Meeting. We
propose the following:
> Define Aether9's activities now
> Agree on the kind of performances we would like to focus on for the next
12 months.
> Commercial activity? (yes/no? how? why? utopia?...)
> Ongoing booklet edition about Aether9
> Preparation of performance for 31st October


- HOW?
Determine the way we are going to discuss:
> are we going to have a moderator? (A person who takes care that anyone has
the opportunity to express and also refrains us to spend more time than
necessary on each subject)
> are we going to work in small groups or alltogether?
> How much time do we give for general matters and separate topics / how
much time for the performance developpment itself.
> regarding the performance, knowing how long it takes to develop a
performance, it might be good to define it before the actual meeting and
start working on it before, in order to spend more "practical rehearsing
time" than brain-storming/developpment time.
> should we make a schedule with morning, afternoon and night sessions ?

- PREPARATION OF BERLIN
In order to have clear and efficient discussion, we propose to reflect
before the Meeting. Here are a couple of propositions FOR EVERY PERSON WHO
WILL ATTEND THE BERLIN MEETING (physically or remotly):
> reflect on the above subjects.
> if you have a performance idea, summarize it (setting, story, aesthetic,
or any other feature)
> prepare a small selection of screenshots (maximum 5) of your favorite
aether9 moments (that you find inspiring, beautiful, interesting or
whatever) and explain why in a few words (to be presented and discussed at
the begginging of the Meeting)

!!! THE IDEA IS NOT TO HAVE BIG MAILING-LIST CONVERSATION NOW !!! We have
the chance to have a physical meeting to communicate more directly. The idea
is to prepare this meeting according to the subjects we would like to
discuss, and anyone who has strong wish to discuss any aspect of the aether9
should express it before, so that we are ready to interact.

OK ?
See you soon,
Chloé (& Boris)

regarding the flat - i also trust your judgement manu.

in addition, i spoke to cym yesterday (IRL!!) and she might be coming as
well so i think a bigger flat is best -

i also think it would be nice to have us all in the same space - though
that will be extremely intense and ironically diametrically opposite to
our usual relationship : )

FYI, here is another short compiled version of our press-text, can be useful to send around:

*****


rupert goldsworthy gallery is premiering an aethereal performance, a wildly dispersed yet intimate collision of live sounds and images.

Developed by an online networked group of international visual artists/collectives working through Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and into the Americas, aether9 is a matrix for video/audio performance, the foundations being  distributed authorship, cross-platform, and 'remote' performance of streaming audio and visual material to a nomadic web interface. 

>From October 26th to 31st, an intensive real-life residency of members of the aether9 group is held at at _____-micro research [berlin], where the artists meet in physical space for the first time.

about aether9
Aether9 is a collaborative art project exploring the field of realtime  
video transmission. It was initiated in May 2007 during a workshop at  
the Mapping Festival in Geneva, Switzerland. Developed by an  
international group of visual artists and collectives working in  
different locations (Europe, North and South America) and  
communicating solely through the Internet, ther9 is a framework for  
networked video/audio performance, and the collaborative development  
of dramarturgical rules particular to Internet modes of communication.  
The system functions as an open platform for participants of any  
technical level to transmit imagery in real-time and interact through  
a structured narrative performance questioning the issues of presence/ 
absence, remote/local, identity and intimacy in the context of the  
electronic space.

[aether] flat joke and other thoughts from c3cil

Next message: [aether] flat joke and other thoughts from c3cil 
Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ] 

Hello aetherians

russian joke:
advertising stating "they take your last (money)"
in front of it, "DPS" (police department) sign
comment: "This takes your motivation without a word."
 ///
I begin to see more clearly about this intensive time we spent together. It
was really great to meet, even if I feel I was "unprepared" for the
intensity of such a meeting... quite unconscious of the human stakes of this
project!
I was touched by each of you and so suprised about this other "human" part.
Maybe some things you cannot write on a chat, it would make them too heavy.
I also feel that beside the problems encountered during the performance, the
story had more depth and flesh than usuall. Because it was related to
something real that we really went through and care about. I wish we go
further in this direction and think of how to represent these aether
adventure. The agents were very good characters, because I see it like this:
a bunch of agents on a mission. These missions not necessarilly clear, but
nevertheless necessary. Isn't this what we like to invent about ourselves,
participating in the aether project? Agents serving a cause... A cause
related with money and technology, with speed and communication, with
material and unmaterial stakes.
I also have a deep memory of this first time were we joined hands with
Cristian included (last rehearsal). It was amazing, it really was connecting
over distance, a similar feeling that people must have had with the very
first long distance communication (telephone and so on). Maybe this tool is
an attempt to create revivals of this feeling actually, and we should try to
focus on performances that are stories about this..?

///

about the performance setting, here are a couple of remarks I thought for
myself. if you agree with this pattern (or would like to think about it with
me), it could be used for future developpment or for workshops. By the way,
I would be interested to lead workshops to guide performance developpment
part, without taking part myself. Would be interesting!
(In addition, I am now starting a project were 100 people are creating a
part of a parade, me and another guy being the artisitic coordinator who
will eventually "stage direct" and write what comes out from all these
imputs...) :

_ NEEDS FOR A PERFORMANCE:
* one person doing only continuity chat and looking at the interface
* one person doing music only
* one voice person doing the narratives
* each image-uploader should deal 2 frames maximum, not more, in order to be
really aware and creative, and especially in order to be FASTER.

_PREPARATION: how to write an efficient script step by step:
* brainstorm around a thema connected with smth actual, happening now.
think of images, not ideas. think of interaction of frames.
>> there are very efficient techniques of brainstorm. I learned some
recently and think we should try them on. you can have a first collection of
homogenoeous idea in not more than 3 hours.
* more accurate brainstorm with maximum 4 people, ending with 4 propositions
for a performance-
*1-2 persons, after discussion, write final proposition
* 1 person write the text (the story to be told, it can be a poem, whatever,
but must be entertaining for the lenght of the performance)
* others organise a general disposition of interface, coherent with the
story and esthetic/ image choices.
* rehearsal: absolutely necessary to do at least one with *everybody*.

thank you all and see you soon aetherians,
Chloé, analisa, c3cil and the others
